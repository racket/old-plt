This directory contains the source code for FrTime and the associated
animation library.  To run the animation/GUI demos, simply open the
corresponding file, make sure the language level is set to (module
...), and execute.  See the demo source code for more information.

Demo 1 (demo1.ss) : A collection of balls that move in circles around
the mouse pointer.  The up and down arrows increase and decrease the
number of these balls, while the left and right arrows adjust their
speed.

Demo 2 (demo2.ss) : Simulation of an engine cylinder.  The left and
right arrows adjust the speed.

Demo 3 (demo3.ss) : Balls moving in circles.

Demo 4 (demo4.ss) : A trail of balls following the mouse.

Demo 5 (demo5.ss) : A ball chasing the mouse.

Demo 6 (demo6.ss) : A simple pong/air-hockey game.  The left paddle
moves with the up and down arrow keys; the right paddle moves with the
mouse.  The 'r' key resets the score.

GUI Demo 1 (gui-demo1.ss) : A simple "pizza ordering" user interface
based on an HtDP exercise.

GUI Demo 2 (gui-demo2.ss) : A simple calculator interface, also based
on an HtDP exercise except that the result updates continuously as the
arguments and operator change.
