  ; there is a problem with Zodiac.  The problem is that Zodiac has not been
  ; distinguishing between top-level variables and those bound by unit clauses.
  ; this is an important distinction to make, because the variables bound by 
  ; unit clauses may take on the `undefined' value, whereas those bound as
  ; top-level variables will never require this check.  (If used before defined,
  ; these values are simply considered unbound.  To this end, Matthew has modified
  ; Zodiac to add a bit of information which aries can use to distinguish these 
  ; fields.  Currently, this information is stored in the `unit?' field of a 
  ; `top-level-varref/bind/unit' structure.  There are cleaner solutions, but
  ; this one fits well into the current state of the world.  This may change at
  ; some point in the future.  For the moment, here is the function which 
  ; distinguishes between these two types of binding:
  
  (define (is-unit-bound? varref)
    (and (z:top-level-varref/bind/unit? varref)
	 (z:top-level-varref/bind/unit-unit? varref)))

  ; before sending things there.
  
  ; jbc additional comments, including elucidation from shriram:
  ; there are three `levels' of parsed stuff:
  ; raw: simple, unannotated scheme values
  ; sexp: simple scheme values with attached zodiac information
  ; parsed: fully parsed into zodiac structures
