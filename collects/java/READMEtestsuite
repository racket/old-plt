The test suite is divided between two sets: files runX and testX.  The
runX files should not generate any compile-time error, whereas testX
files do.

The testX Java files
--------------------

Name                 Purpose

testHierarchy        Search field and methods through hierarchies of
                     interfaces and classes.

                     interfaces.

testCycleType        Test cycle in declarations of interfaces and classes.

testExtensionInterface
