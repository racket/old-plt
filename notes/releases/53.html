PLT Release Notes</h2>

<p>

<b>Current Release</b>:<tt> </tt> 53 <br>
<b>Release Date</b>:<tt> </tt> July 25, 1998.

<p>


DrScheme v53 is primarily a bug-fix release.  Many of the fixes
are a result of the TeachScheme! 1998 Workshop held at 
Rice University. 

This note summarizes the major differences between this release
and DrScheme v52.

<h2> The Future </h2>

PLT intends to conduct a major release by the end of this year or early
next year. The changes will directly affect users of MrEd, the graphical
toolbox. Please expect deletions of features, additions, and a few
modifications. DrScheme will migrate to a graphical multi-module
environment.  This change should not affect beginners or teachers. 

<P>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>DrScheme, MrEd, and MzScheme have
significantly improved performance on PowerPC Macintoshes.
</ul>

See the HISTORY files in notes/drscheme descriptions of other changes and 
bug fixes for DrScheme.

MzScheme and MrEd users should look at the HISTORY 
files in notes/mzscheme and notes/mred for detailed descriptions of 
changes and bug fixes for those applications.
