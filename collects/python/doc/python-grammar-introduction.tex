This section presents the grammar for Python programs currently supported by the Python-to-Scheme compiler.

The starting non-terminal is usually \synt{file_input} (\ref{filezzzinputb}), but \linebreak[4] \synt{eval_input} (\ref{evalzzzinputb}) is used instead by the \verb|eval| function.

If a non-terminal is named \synt{nonterm_list_plus}, it is assumed that it defines the regular expression \emph{nonterm+}, while \synt{nonterm_list} usually defines the regular expression \emph{nonterm*}, though it might be \emph{(nonterm ,)*} as well.

The empty string is represented by \greeke{}.
