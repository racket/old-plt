The utilities in this directory try to help in linking external C++
code into MzScheme. The utilities are now deprecated, but they're
still used to build MrEd.

xctocc is decribed in the manual "PLT xctocc: C++ Glue Generator
Manual" (available on request). xcglue.c and xcglue.h are used by the
code generated by xctocc.

The xctosig script takes any number of .xc file names on its command
line and writes out type information that can be used by
MrSpidey. This information needs to be filtered through the sigclean
script, though. (Edit the path to mzscheme at the top of the script.)

The other two scripts are less useful. The xctotex script takes any
number of .xc file names and generates a simple table for LaTeX-based
documentation that enumerates all of the things defined. The xctotest
script generates some robustness-testing code in the form used by MrEd
(see mred/tests/setup.ss).
