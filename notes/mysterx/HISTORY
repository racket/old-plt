Version 103-p1:

Added optional index argument to 
 find-element, find-element-by-id-or-name
 methods of mx-document%
Added methods get-html, get-text to
 mx-element% class

Methods find-element, find-element-by-id-or-name,
 and find-elements-with-tag can return the BODY
 element itself, as well as its children
When a custodian shuts down an mx-browser% object,
 its Win32 window is destroyed
Fixed marshalling of BYREF parameters to COM event 
 handlers, for several types; added VT_INT and 
 VT_INT | VT_BYREF 
Added com-add-ref, com-ref-count procedures
Secondary Windows event loop checks for
 WM_TIMER messages; some programs were blocking
 on these when run from DrScheme

Added support for VT_INT 
Added conversions com-scode->number,
 number->com-scode, com-currency->number,
 number->com-currency, com-date->date,
 date->com-date

 com-date?
Removed 'no-caption option for mx-browser%,
 until we can make it work

Version 102-p1:

Added synonyms cci/coclass for 
 cocreate-instance-from-coclass, and cci/progid
 for cocreate-instance-from-progid
com-all-coclasses, com-all-controls return
 sorted lists
Fixed bug when methods, properties return
 NULL COM objects
Added procedure mx-version

Version 102:

cocreate-instance renamed to 
 cocreate-instance-from-coclass;
 added cocreate-instance-from-progid;
 both of these procedures support 
 running remote servers
for mx-document% and mx-element% classes, split
 insert-object and append-object methods into
 {insert,append}-object-from-coclass and  
 {insert,append}-object-from-progid
added Scheme-syntax property getters and 
 setters for HTML elements; old string versions
 are available as "-native" methods
created mx-browser% class with methods
 navigate, go-back, go-forward, 
 current-url, register-navigate-handler, 
 unregister-navigate-handler, 
 current-document; show and event-handling
 method of mx-document% moved to the new class
constructor for mx-browser% takes same arguments
 as old constructor for mx-document%; style
 list may include 'scrollbars
com-methods no longer returns methods inherited from 
 IDispatch; results are alphabetically-sorted,
 also true for com-get-properties, com-set-properties
for COM event-handling procedures, added 
 check for ambiguous COM class; added 
 procedures set-coclass! and 
 set-coclass-from-progid! to allow 
 explicit disambiguation; procedures 
 coclass and progid return current value
added find-element-by-id-or-name,
 elements-with-tag to mx-document%
added methods selection and 
 set-selection to mx-element%
added focus method to mx-element%;

 and word-spacing properties, since not 
 implemented by IE4/5 for Windows
fixed GC-related problems with COM 
 event handlers
fixed error text formatting bug when 
 COM methods returned an error code
DHTML test code added, 
 plt/tests/mysterx/dhtmltests.ss
improved Makefiles
Setup PLT prints warning when no binaries
 installed

Version 101:

moved Windows event loop from mx-document% class
  initialization to unit
extra Windows processing loop handles only 
  WM_USER events, fixing various problems 
  running MysterX under DrScheme
added AddRef() for HTML elements, fixing
  occasional crashes on GC
added tag, id information for find-element
  failures
renamed mysterx.dll to mxmain.dll, moved all
  dll's to dlls subdirectory
added clean option to Makefile

Version 100:

    arguments
added call to CoUninitialize() from exit handler
  
Version 100alpha4:

added support for multidimensional arrays,
  with COM SAFEARRAYs stored column-major
added com-unregister-event-handler
COM event handlers accept named arguments
unit exit-handler forces Release() on global
  COM objects on exit
COM objects passed as VARIANTs in methods,
  properties 
garbage collection of COM objects passed to 
  COM event handlers works correctly
added procedures for com-type's,
  com-object-type and com-is-a?
procedures com-methods, com-get-properties, 
  com-set-properties, com-events,
  com-method-type, com-get-property-type,

added com-object?
added finalizers for COM objects inserted
	into HTML or returned from methods
