> (tex2page filename)

runs tex2page in the current namespace, but

 * \eval{} tends not to work, because the tex2page facilities are not
   imported into the namespace;

 * concurrent tex2page runs in different threads can collide, because
   the tex2page implementation contains many state variables; 

 * the current namespace may be polluted, because \eval{}s may create
   top-level definitions.


Exported by "fresh-tex2page.ss":

> (tex2page/fresh-namespace filename)

runs tex2page in a freshly created namespace with a fresh
instantiation of tex2page; \eval{} will work properly, threads will
not collide, and existing namespaces will not be polluted.
