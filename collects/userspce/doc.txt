_Userspace_ libraries implement the common functionality
between DrScheme and DrScheme Jr.

The libraries _beginner.ss_, _intermediate.ss_,
_advanced.ss_, and _everything.ss_ implement the additional
function definitions that appear in the initial namespace in
the respective language levels. The other language levels do
not have any additional function definitions beyond what is
in the namespace automatically. Each of these files uses the
predicate (defined? 'mred^) to determine if they are running
in DrScheme or DrScheme Jr, and include the graphical
portions only in DrScheme.

- beginner.ss adds:
  - mzlib's core libraries
  - simple-draw.ss

- intermediate.ss adds exactly what beginner.ss does

- advanced.ss adds:
  - mzlib's core libraries
  - Sixlib, in graphics.ss in the graphics library,
  - simple-draw.ss, and
  - the turtles, from turtle.ss in the graphics library

- everything.ss adds exactly what advanced adds.


The _simple-draw.ss_ library implements a simple drawing
library on top of sixlib. It uses _error.ss_.
