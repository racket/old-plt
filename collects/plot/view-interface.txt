DESCRIPTION/METHODS
-------------------

plot-view%:
	Provides fascilities for starting and finishing plots. The underlying c-library
	follows and implicit sequence contract and this class will (at some point) enforce
      	that contract.
	
	methods:

	start-plot: 
	starts the plot - calls plplot to open a file stream for writing

        finish-plot: 
	finishes the plot - calss plplot to close the file, clean up. also loads the created image

        set-line-color: symbol -> void
	sets the line colour

        set-line-width: number -> void
	sets the line width

        get: symbol -> any
	getter for a few of the fields

        set: symbol any -> void
	setter for a few of the fields

        set-plot-environment: number number number number number number -> void
	sets the 2d plot environment (x and y range), justification, other options

        reset-to-default: 
	resets the state of the c-code to default, called after every renderer

2d-vew% extends plot-view
	Provides an interface to drawing 2d plots. Some methods call low level functions, others are 
      	written in scheme.

	Methods:
  
 	set-labels: string string string -> void
	Sets x, y and title labels
        
        plot-vector: posn posn -> void
	plots a single vector

        plot-vectors: (listof (list posn posn)) -> void
	plots a list of vectors

        plot-points: (listof posn) number ->void
	plots points using a specified charater

        plot-line: (listof posn) -> void
	plots a line given a set of points

        plot-contours: (listof (lisftof number)) (listof number) (listof number) (listof number) ->void
	plots a grid representing a 3d function using contours to distinguish levels
	args are grid, xvalues yvalues and levels to plot

        plot-shades: (listof (lisftof number)) (listof number) (listof number) (listof number) ->void
	plots a grid representing a 3d function using shades to represent height (z)
	args are same as contours


3d-vew% extends plot-view
	Provides an interface to drawing 3d plots. Just started

	Methods:
  
        box-3d: Sets up the 3d drawing box settings, including ticks and lables
        
        world3d: Sets ups the 3d world - min/max coordinates / view angles 

        plot3d: draws a 3d surface plot given a grid
