  This collection is the aligned-pasteboard collection. It implements
pasteboards with automatic geometry management. There are four names
provided by the collection. They are:

  vertical-pasteboard% implements aligned-pasteboard<%>
    a pasteboard with all of its children snips aligned vertically.
  horizontal-pasteboard% implements algined-pasteboard<%>
    a pasteboard with all of its children snips aligned horizontally.
  aligned-editor-canvas% implements aligned-pasteboard-parent<%>
    a special editor-canvas% for containing aligned pasteboards.
  aligned-editor-snip% implemenets aligned-pasteboard-parent<%>
    a special editor-snip% for containing aligned pasteboards.
  aligned-pasteboard<%>
    an interface defining what an aligned-pasteboard must implement
  aligned-pasteboard-parent<%>
    an interface defining a container suitable for aligned-pasteboard<%>
  aligned-snip<%>
    an interface that must be implemented if a snip within an editor is
    to be resized by the geometry-management

  The four classes are used just as their parental counter parts. The only
difference is that an aligned-pasteboard% may only be contained in one
aligned-editor-container<%> at a time maximum. Further an
aligned-editor-container<%> may contain only an aligned-pasteboard<%>
and an aligned-pasteboard<%> may only be contained in an
aligned-editor-container<%>

  Certain methods no longer make sence in the interface to the
aligned-pasteboards. For example move-to should not be called by the
user as moving and resizing of snips is all done automatically by
the pasteboard. The following methods should not be called by the user:

  in aligned-pasteboard<%>
    move
    move-to
    resize

  in aligned-snip<%>
    resize

  in aligned-editor-snip%
    set-min-height
    set-min-height

Known Bugs:

  there is currently no use of spacing in aligned-pasteboard<%>. It is
intended to give a space between children snips in the pasteboard. This
may be implemented later and its not very important.

  users are able to move the snips in the pasteboard by highlighting the
the snip and using the keyboard arrows. this should be disabled. in
locked-pasteboard. I do not see a way of disabling this in the help desk.
