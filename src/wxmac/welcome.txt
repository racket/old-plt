Welcome to wxWindows Version 1.60


Hello, and welcome to wxWindows, a portable GUI
toolkit for X and Windows 3.1.

This program demonstrates the following features:

*   Main frame window with menu bar

*   Panel with various widgets

*   Status line with help on menu items

*   Scrolling text window with this file loaded

*   Scrolling canvas with text and graphics displayed
    (use the mouse and left button to doodle)

*   Icon and cursor setting

*   Canvas scaling

*   Printing (Windows printing on PC, PostScript under UNIX)

*   Copying a metafile to the clipboard (Windows only)

*   Timer (prints to this text window occasionally)

Other wxWindows features include:

*   Interprocess communication (DDE on both platforms)

*   File browser dialog box

*   Form construction facility

wxWindows provides a common core of GUI facilities across several
platforms (two at present). XView programmers will be familiar with
the frame/subwindow principles, whilst appreciating the simpler and
object-oriented interface. Windows programmers should also find it
much simpler than the native API. Motif programmers should never again
have to experiment to avoid constraint contradictions. And,
synchronous interprocess communications are now a doddle on all
supported platforms.

This software is available free of charge from:
