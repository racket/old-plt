This is the PLT software package folder.The following only applies if you DID NOT get a Stuffit archive, oryou did not use suntar to extract a .tar archive:  Un-MacBinary these files:   plt:DrScheme.bin   plt:MrEd.XXX.bin      (needed for DrScheme)   plt:MzScheme.XXX.bin   plt:mzc.bin   plt:collects:launcher:MzStarter.bin   plt:collects:launcher:MrStarter.bin where "XXX" is "68k" or "PPC".Applications------------These are the applications:  plt:DrScheme -- PLT's Scheme development environment  plt:MrEd  -- a Scheme GUI engine  plt:MzScheme -- a text-based Scheme interpreter  plt:mzc -- the MzScheme compilerDrScheme relies on MrEd, and mzc relies onMzScheme. You may not have some of these packages depending on whichdistribution you downloaded.DrScheme is implemented through MrEd and uses the MrEd application.DrScheme needs a lot of memory - at least 24MB. Give the MrEdapplication as much memory as possible for its partition (i.e., setthe application size using the "Get Info" dialog in Finder.)Compiling---------If you downloaded the source code distribution instead of the standarddistribution, you must compile MzScheme and MrEd before using the PLTsoftware (including DrScheme). For compilation instructions, unpackthe Compactor archive plt/src/cw.cpt to plt/src/cw and read the ABOUTfiles. Both MrEd and MzScheme must be compiled for DrScheme. If there is no cw.cpt or cw.cpt.hqx file in plt/src, then you did notdownload the source code distribution and you should be ready to run.Documentation-------------Some documentation may be included in plt:collects:doc, but some ofthe PLT documentation must be downloaded separately from theexecutables.HTML documentation for PLT software should be installed intoplt:collects:doc. For example, the DrScheme documenation should be inplt:collects:doc:drscheme, with button icons inplt:collects:doc:icons.DrScheme and MrEd will automatically add documentation installed inplt:collects:doc to the "Help" menu.More Information----------------For more information, see  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/
