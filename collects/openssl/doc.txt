The _openssl_ collection provides glue for the OpenSSL library with
the MzScheme port system. The OpenSSL collection functions nearly
identically to the standard TCP subsystems in PLT Scheme, with a few
additional flags.

> ssl-available? 

A boolean value which says whether the system openssl library was successfully 
loaded. Calling ssl-connect or ssl-connect/enable-break when this value is #f 
(library not loaded) will raise an error.

-- Client ----------------------------------------

> (ssl-connect hostname port-k [protocol-symbol])

Connect to the given host (a string) on the given port-k (a number
from 1 to 65535). This encryption will be encrypted using SSL. The
optional `protocol-symbol' determines which encryption protocol is
used. At the current time, `protocol-symbol' must be one of the
following: 'sslv2-or-v3 (SSL protocol versions 2 or 3, as appropriate;
this is the default), 'sslv2 (SSL protocol version 2), 'sslv3 (SSL
protocol version 3), or 'tls (the TLS protocol version 1). The return
values are as tcp-connect; an input port and an output port.

> (ssl-connect/enable-break hostname port-k [flag])

Like ssl-connect, but breaking is enabled while trying to connect. 

-- Server ----------------------------------------

> (ssl-listen port-k [queue-k reuse? hostname-or-#f protocol-symbol])

Like `tcp-listen', but the result is an SSL listener (which is a
waitable object). The extra optional `protocol-symbol' is as for
`ssl-connect'.

Call `ssl-load-certificate-chain' and `ssl-load-private-key' to
avoid a _no shared cipher_ error on accepting connections.

> (ssl-close ssl-listener)
> (ssl-listener? v)

Analogous to `tcp-close' and `tcp-listener?'.

> (ssl-load-certification-chain ssl-listener pathname)

Loads a certification chain file for connections to be accepted for
`ssl-listener'.

> (ssl-load-private-key ssl-listener pathname [rsa? asn1?])

Loads the firprivate key from `pathname' for connections to be
accepted for `ssl-listener'. If `rsa?' is #t (the default), the first
RSA key is read (i.e., non-RSA keys are skipped). If `asn1?' is #t
(the default is #f), the file is parsed as ASN1format instead of PEM.

> (ssl-accept ssl-listener)

Analogous to `tcp-accept'.
