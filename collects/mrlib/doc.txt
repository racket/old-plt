_graph.ss_

The graph.ss library provides a graph drawing toolkit, built
out of mred's pasteboard%s.

In provides four exports: graph-snip<%>, graph-snip-mixin,
graph-pasteboard-mixin, and add-links.

============================================================

The _graph-pasteboard-mixin_ does not add any methods to
pasteboard%. It overrides many methods to draw lines between
graph-snip<%>s that it contains.

============================================================

The _graph-snip<%>_ interface has these methods:

> (send a graph-snip<%> get-children) - returns a list of
   snips that implement graph-snip<%>. Each of these snips
   will have a line drawn from it, pointing at this snip.

> (send a graph-snip<%> add-child (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)) -
  adds a child of this snip. Instead of calling this method,
  consider using the add-child function provided from this
  library. 

> (send a graph-snip<%> remove-child (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)) - 
  removes a child snip from this snip. Be sure to remove this
  snip as a parent from the argument, too.
  

> (send a graph-snip<%> get-parents) - returns a list of
  snips that implement graph-snip<%>. Each of these
  snips will have a line drawn to it, starting from this
  snip. 

> (send a graph-snip<%> add-parent (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>))
> (send a graph-snip<%> add-parent (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)
                                   (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
                                   (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
                                   (union false? (is-a?/c brush%))
                                   (union false? (is-a?/c brush%)))
  adds a parent of this snip. Instead of calling this method,
  consider using the add-child function provided from this
  library. 

> (send a graph-snip<%> remove-parent)
  removes a parent snip from this snip. Be sure to remove this
  snip as a child from the argument, too.

> (send a graph-snip<%> get-parent-links) - this method is
  only used internally. It returns a list of opaque
  structures that contain information about the parent snips
  and what color the links between them should be.

============================================================

The _graph-snip-mixin_ adds the graph-snip<%> functionality
to a snip%.

============================================================

The _add-links_ function connects a parent snip to a child
snip in the same pasteboard.

> (add-links (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>) (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>))
> (add-links (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>) 
             (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)
             (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c brush%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c brush%)))

When called with two arguments, connects the snips using a
blue/purple color scheme for the links. The first snip is
the parent and the second snip is the child.

When called with four arguments, uses the two pens and
brushes for the color scheme. The first pen and the first
brush are used when the mouse cursor is over the snip
(or a child or parent) and the second pen and brush are used
when the mouse cursor is not over the snip. The brush is used to
draw inside the arrow head and the pen is used to draw the
border of the arrowhead and the line connecting the two
snips.
