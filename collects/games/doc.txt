_Games_
=======

The "Games" (Unix: plt/bin/games) executable is created by "Setup PLT"
(Unix: plt/bin/setup-plt). You can also start Games via Help Desk
(search for "games").

The Games program lets you select one of the games distributed by PLT,
or other games installed as sub-collections of the "games" collection
(see below).

 * _Same_ - The object is to score points by removing dots from the
   board. Click the "Help" button in Same for more details.

                                              - by Robby

 * _Go Fish_ (against two computer players) - The children's card game
   where you try to get rid of all you cards by forming pairs. The
   status line at the bottom of the window provides instructions as
   you go. [The computer players are not smart.]

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Crazy 8s_ (against two computer players) - The card game where you
   try to get rid of all you cards by matching the value or suit of
   the top card in the discard pile. An 8 can be discarded at any
   time, and in that case, the player who discarded the 8 gets to pick
   any suit for it (hence the craziness of 8s). A player can choose to
   draw a card insteda of discarding, as long as cards are left in the
   draw pile, and a player's turn continues after drawing (so a player
   can continue drawing to find something to discard). If no cards are
   left in the deck, a player may pass instead of discarding. The
   status line at the bottom of the window provides instructions as
   you go. [The computer players are not smart.]

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Blackjack_ - Standard rules, plus the following specifics:

      - 1 player (not counting the dealer)
      - 4 decks, reshuffled after 3/4 of the cards are used
      - Dealer stands on soft 17s
      - Splitting is allowed only on the first two cards, and only if
        they are equal; 10 and the face cards are all considered equal
        for splitting
      - Doubling is allowed on all unsplit hands, not on split hands
      - No blackjacks after splitting
      - No surrender
      - No insurance
      - No maximum under-21 hand size
      - Dealer's second card is not revealed if the player busts (or
        both halves of a split hand bust)

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Rummy_ (against the computer) - A simple variant of Rummy: put all
   cards in your hand into straights (3 or more cards) and 3- or
   4-of-a-kind sets to win. Each card must be used in one set. On each
   turn, you can either draw from the deck or from the top of the
   discard pile, then you must discard one of your own cards. Aces can
   be used in both A-2-3 sequences and Q-K-A sequences. [The computer
   player is fairly smart.]

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Minesweeper_ - A simple version of the classic tile-removing game.

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Memory_ (matching game) - In case you have small children, too.

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Paint by Number_ - A logic game. Click the "Help" button in Paint
   by Numbers for more details.

                                              - by Robby

 * _Lights Out_ - A color-toggling game. Click the "Help" button in
   Lights Out for more details.

                                              - by Robby

 * _Pousse_ - A game similar to tic-tac-toe, but tokens are pushed
   onto the board and can move other pieces. Click the "Help" button
   in Pousse for more details. You can install your own player
   programs. (This game was part of the 1998 ICFP programming
   contest.)

                                              - by Matthew

 * _GCalc_ - Not really a game, but a demonstration of "concrete
   abstractions".  See
     http://www.grame.fr/Research/GCalcul/Graphic_Calculus.html
     ftp://ftp.grame.fr/pub/Documents/ICMC94LambdaCalc.pdf
   for the theoretic details, and see the doc.txt file for usage
   instructions.

Implementing new Games
----------------------

The game-starting console inspects the sub-collections of the "games"
collection. If a sub-collection has an info.ss definition (see the mzc
manual), the following fields of the collection's "info.ss" file are
used:

 * `game' [required] : used as a library name in the sub-collection to
    load for the game; the library must export a `game-unit' unsigned
    unit (see MzLib's `unit' form); the unit is invoked with no
    imports to start the game.

 * `name' [defauls to the collection name] : used to label the
   game-starting button in the game console.

 * `game-icon' [defaults to collection name with ".png"] : used as a
   path to a bitmap file taht is used for the game button's label;
   this image should be 32 x 32 and have a mask.

 * `game-set' [defaults to "Other Games"] : a label used to group
   games that declare themselves to be in the same set.

To implement card games, see the documentation for the "cards"
sub-collection of the "games" collection. Card games typically belong
in the "Cards" game set.
