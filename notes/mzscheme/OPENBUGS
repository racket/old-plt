(let loop ([x 0]) (call/cc loop)) accumulates memory

Under Unix and Mac OS, a DNS lookup by tcp-connect blocks all
 MzScheme threads; note that the "net" collection contains a
 partial DNS client implementation that does not have this problem

Under Unix, opening a special file can block all MzScheme threads
 (e.g., a FIFO with no connected writer)

Under AIX 3.2, write to tcp output port blocks MzScheme when the
  low-level buffer is full

On Alpha machines, inexact negative zero is not handled correctly
