_SLaTeX_
========

The use SLaTeX as a standalone program, either drag your .tex file onto
SLaTeX (on the macintosh or windows), or type "slatex file" at the command
prompt (under windows or X).

Under the macintosh, SLaTeX will attempt to run OzTeX. If you do not have
OzTeX installed, or use another version of LaTeX, this will fail and you
can run your own version manually.

To use SLaTeX in a program, require _slatex.ss_:

  (require-library "slatex.ss" "slatex")

The file slatex.ss defines one procedure:

> (slatex filename)

which accepts a string naming a file and runs slatex and latex on the
file. Note that this must be the correct filename -- do include the ".tex"
suffix.
