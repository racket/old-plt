This directory contains code for testing Help Desk.
Because many of the tests use MysterX, the code 
will only run under Windows.  And you'll need to 
install MysterX, besides.

To run the tests, run the batch file `go.bat'.  It 
presumes that MzScheme is in your PATH.

There are two kinds of tests that are run.

The first kind of test tries to `load' each
servlet file.  If there's a servlet syntax error, 
you'll see a message like

  *** Load error *** in servlets foo.ss

The second kind of test uses a browser to navigate
to servlets reachable from the Help Desk home page.
Some servlets are ignored, such as the bug report 
form or the missing manual page, because they have
have side effects not desirable during testing.
For offsite content, the checker does not check
links contained in that content.
