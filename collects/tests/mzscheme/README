To run all of the tests, run:
 > (load "PATHTOHEREall.ss")
where PATHTOHERE is the path to this directory.  

Test failures may cause the test to stop before finishing, but most
test failures will let the test continue, and a summary message at the
end will enummerate the failures that occurred.

Some files are directories are created (in the current directory)
during the run. The files are named "tmp<N>" where <N> is a number.
The directory is named "deep". If the test suite passes, the directory
should be removed, but some "tmp<N>" files will remain. (The "tmp<N>"
files are automatically replaced if the test suite is run again.)

Unless your machine clock is always exactly in sync with your disk,
don't worry about failures that look like this:
  ((path) (#f #t (#<|primitive:<=|> 11 39 11)))
  ((path) (#f #t (#<|primitive:<=|> 11 39 11)))
  ((path) (#f #t (#<|primitive:<=|> 11 39 11)))

Additionally, test expand-defmacro by running:
 > (load "PATHTOHEREexpand.ss")

Test compilation and writing/reading compiled code with:
 > (load "PATHTOHEREcompile.ss")

Run the tests with no output except for the results with:
 > (load "PATHTOHEREquiet.ss")

Run 3 copies of the test suite concurrently in separate threads:
 > (load "PATHTOHEREparallel.ss")

MzLib tests are run with:
 > (load "PATHTOHEREmzlib.ss")


To run the test suite in MzRice, use these flags:
  --case-insens --auto-else --no-set-undef --no-sig-undef
