_default-style.ss_

  This file, when loaded, returns an association list
  mapping from naming various syntactic categories. 
  The symbols are:

      keyword
      unbound-variable 
      bound-variable 
      primitive
      global
      constant
      comment
      base
      

  The `base' category applies to "everything else", mostly parens.
  
  The symbols map to elements of this type:
  
    
   (cons (union string
                (list number number number))
         (listof (union 'slant 'bold 'underline)))
   

   The first element in the list is the color of the text. If it
   is a string, it is expected to name a color and if it is a
   list, the values in the list are the red, green, and blue
   components of the color. The rest of the list contains the
   style attributes, either italic aka slant, bold, or underlined.

_Check Syntax colors_
   
   Check Syntax uses the above table for its defaults, but the
   user can set whatever colors they want. To get the colors
   the user is currently using, use the preferences system in
   the framework. For each entry in the table above, there
   is a corresponding preference setting, built by concatenating
   `drscheme:check-syntax:' to the front of the symbol.
   For example, to get the preference for keywords, use:
   
      (preferences:get 'drschem:check-syntax:keyword)
      
   This returns a style delta.
