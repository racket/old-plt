 Compiling for MacOS X
========================================================================

It is possible to compile MzScheme for OS X using only make & cc.
However, the preferred method for MzScheme compilation and the only
method for MrEd compilation is to use Codewarrior 7.0.  Instructions
for compiling MzScheme without Codewarrior appear at the end of this 
file.  Nevertheless, the Codewarrior compilation does require the use
of make and cc, so familiarity with the command line is required.
Also, these instructions are needlessly complicated because I haven't
yet written scripts to do everything in the right order.

Compiling for Mac OS X using Codewarrior (and cc):

0) You must have the Apple Developer Tools installed, as well
as Codewarrior 7.0.

1) cd to the plt/src directory, and execute './configure'

2) cd to plt/src/mzscheme, and execute 'make g-c'

3) cd to plt/src/mac/cw and execute:
  Rez -UseDF MzScheme.r -o MzScheme.rsrc.OSX
  Rez -UseDF MrEd.r -o MrEd.rsrc.OSX

4) Follow the instructions for building MzScheme-app.mcp contained
in plt/src/mac/cw/README (basically, open the project file and compile it)


3) Follow the instructions for building MzScheme-app.mcp and MrEd.mcp
contained in plt/src/mac/cw/readme


Compiling for Mac OS X using only cc :

0) You must have the Apple Developer Tools installed.

1) in the files plt/src/mzscheme/sconfig.h and plt/include/sconfig.h,
comment out the #define for MACINTOSH_EVENTS.  That is, change
# define MACINTOSH_EVENTS
to
/*# define MACINTOSH_EVENTS */

2) cd to plt/src, and execute './configure'

3) execute 'make mz'

4) execute 'make mzinstall'
