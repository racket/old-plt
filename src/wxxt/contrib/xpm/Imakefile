XCOMM You may need to modify the following DEFINES variable as follows:
XCOMM if your system doesn't provide strcasecmp add -DNEED_STRCASECMP
XCOMM if your system doesn't provide strdup add -DNEED_STRDUP
XCOMM if your system doesn't provide pipe remove -DZPIPE

#if defined(UltrixArchitecture) || \
    (defined(MipsArchitecture) && !defined(SGIArchitecture))
DEFINES = -DZPIPE -DNEED_STRDUP
#else
DEFINES = -DZPIPE
#endif

XCOMM You can uncomment the following line to avoid building the shared lib
XCOMM IMAKE_DEFINES = -DSharedLibXpm=NO

XCOMM Normaly the following part should not need to be edited

#define IHaveSubdirs
#define PassCDebugFlags 'CDEBUGFLAGS=$(CDEBUGFLAGS)' 'DEFINES=$(DEFINES)'

     SUBDIRS = lib sxpm
