The "lang" collection defines a number of modules that can serve as
languages for other modules (i.e., as the initial import):

 * _r5rs.ss_ - provides R5RS Scheme

 * _plt-pretty-big-text.ss_ - provides MzScheme plus the
   following MzLib libraries: etc.ss, file.ss, list.ss,
   class.ss, unit.ss, unitsig.ss, include.ss, defmacro.ss,
   pretty.ss, string.ss, thread.ss, math.ss, match.ss, and
   shared.ss

 * _plt-pretty-big.ss_ - provides plt-pretty-big-text.ss
    plus the MrEd classes. This corresponds to the
    _Pretty Big Scheme_ language in DrScheme.

 * _htdp-beginner.ss_ - provides Beginning Student

 * _htdp-beginner-abbr.ss_ - provides Beginning Student with List Abbreviations

 * _htdp-intermediate.ss_ - provides Intermediate Student

 * _htdp-intermediate-lambda.ss_ - provides Intermediate Student with Lambda

 * _htdp-advanced.ss_ - provides Advanced Student

In addition, the "lang" collection defines two modules that supply
special teaching functions:

 * _posn.ss_ - provides the `posn' structure

 * _imageeq.ss_ - provides the `image=?' function
