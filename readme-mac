This is the PLT software package folder for MacOS.IMPORTANT: After unpacking this distribution, run the Setup PLT application in the plt folder.Applications------------The following are the applications:  DrScheme -- the Scheme development environment  DrScheme Jr -- a text-only version of DrScheme  MzScheme -- a text-only Scheme interpreter  MrEd -- a graphical Scheme interpreter  mzc -- a Scheme compiler  Help Desk --- for Help (also built into DrScheme)DrScheme relies on MrEd (i.e., the DrScheme application launchesMrEd with special startup instructions), and DrScheme Jr and mzc relyon MzScheme. You may not have some of these applications, dependingon which distribution you downloaded.Compiling---------If you downloaded the source code distribution instead of the standarddistribution, you must compile MzScheme and MrEd before using the PLTsoftware (including DrScheme). For compilation instructions, unpack the Compactor archiveplt:src:cw.sit.hqx, producing plt:src:cw. Read the README file inplt:src:cw.If there is no plt:src:mzscheme folder, you did not downloadthe source code distribution. In that case, you should be ready torun.License-------PLT SoftwareCopyright (c) 1995-99 PLTPLT software is distributed under the GNU Library General PublicLicense (LGPL).
