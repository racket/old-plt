<h2>How to use Help Desk</h2>

Help Desk is your complete source of information about the PLT
software, including DrScheme, MzScheme, and MrEd. 

<P>

You can use Help Desk to find information in two ways:

<P>

<font color="forest green">
1) Navigate the Help Desk information pages by clicking on
      hyperlinks. </font>

      <UL>

      <LI> Use the <B><TT>Rewind</TT></B> and <B><TT>Forward</TT></B>
      buttons to retrace your steps.

      <LI> The <B><TT>Home</TT></B> button always takes you back to
      the starting page.

      </UL>

 <P>
 
<font color="forest green">
 2)   Search for terms using the <B><TT>Find docs for</TT></B>
      field at the bottom of Help Desk. </font>

      <UL>

      <LI> Enter one or more terms into the <B><TT>Find docs
           for</TT></B> field.

      <LI> Click the <B><TT>Search</TT></B> button (or type Enter or
           Return) to start a search.

      <LI> Help Desk scans the information pages and returns a list of
           hyperlinks for <i>keyword</i>, <i>index entry</i>, and
           <i>raw text</i> matches:

          <UL>

          <LI> <i>Keywords</i> are Scheme names, such as <tt>define</tt>
               and <tt>cons</tt>.

          <LI> <i>Index entries</i> are topical phrases, such as "lists".

          <LI> <i>Raw text</i> results are fragments of text from the
               information pages. (Raw text results are useful only as
               a last resort.)

          </UL>

      <LI> Expert users can adjust the search with the popup-menu
           controls to the right of the <B><TT>Search</TT></B> button.

      <P>

      Help Desk sorts search results according to their source
      first, and according to their (apparent) relevance second.
