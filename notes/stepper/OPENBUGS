The stepper no longer works with the "Intermediate" language.
More accurately, perhaps, the Intermediate language is no 
longer compatible with the stepper.  

The stepper doesn't handle 'include' provided as a teachpack
element.

Primitives like 'make-number/make-numeric' that are renamed
as module provides are not displayed using their renamed
names.

Inexact numbers are not printed with a leading #i.
