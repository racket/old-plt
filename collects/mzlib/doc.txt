The _class-sneaky.ss_ file in the private subcollection of
mzlib provides all the same names as the class.ss module,
plus one more:

> (class*/names-sneaky ...)

This form is just the same as class*/names, except that for
these primitives:

  is-a?
  subclass?
  class->interface

it behaves like its superclass, rather than being a new
class. This is intended for the contract library only, since
it needs to be able to create wrapper classes that act just
like the original classes.
