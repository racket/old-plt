This directory contains several examples of PLT-Scheme servlets.

hello.ss
  The hello servlet demonstrates how a minimal servlet can provide 
  functionality similar to server-side includes.

count.ss
  The count servlet shows how a servlet can maintain state between invocations.
  The state is reset when the cache of loaded servlets is refreshed.

add.ss
  The add servlet uses send/suspend to interact with the user multiple times.

To construct a multi-unit servlet that combines code from several files,
see the subdirectory "compound".
