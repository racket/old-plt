This directory contains the source code for FrTime.

To run the animation/GUI demos, simply set the language level to
FrTime, open the corresponding file, and Execute.  See the demo source
code for more information.

orbit-mouse.ss : A collection of balls that move in circles around
the mouse pointer.

piston.ss : Simulation of a piston/cylinder.

rotation.ss : Balls moving in circles.

delay-mouse.ss : A trail of balls following the mouse.

ball-on-string.ss : A ball chasing the mouse.

pong.ss : A simple pong/air-hockey game.  The left paddle moves with
numeric keypad; the right paddle moves with the mouse.  The 'r' key
resets the score.

net-pong-*.ss : A networked version of the pong/air-hockey game.
Currently known to work under Linux.  To play, open the client on one
machine and the server on another.  Execute both (and require if
necessary, depending on language level).  Evaluate (self) on each.
Results will be something like:

[client]
> (self)
#3(tid 128.148.38.2:1180 main)

and
[server]
> (self)
#3(tid 128.148.33.71:1178 main)

Now tell each machine about the other:
[client]
> (set-cell! server (make-tid '128.148.33.71 1178 'frtime-heart))

[server]
> (set-cell! client (make-tid '128.148.38.2 1180 'frtime-heart))

Note the differences between the #3(tid ...) output and the (make-tid ...)
commands---there is no colon (:) between the host and port, and main becomes
'frtime-heart.

After setting the cells, complete the connection by clicking the left
mouse button in both animation windows.  The player running the server
can reset the score by pressing 'r'.

pizza.ss : A simple "pizza ordering" user interface based on an HtDP
exercise.

calculator.ss : A simple calculator interface, also based on an HtDP
exercise except that the result updates continuously as the arguments
and operator change.

Robb Cutler's Examples

analog-clock.ss : An animated real-time clock.  A slider adjusts the radius
of the face.  Click and drag to move the face around.

growing-points.ss : A field of points that grow as the mouse approaches.

needles.ss : A field of needles that point at the mouse.
