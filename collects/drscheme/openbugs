- in the language dialog box, "allow set! on undefined" is ignored

- in the lowest language level (define (f . x) x) is incorrectly a
  syntax error.

- breaking an infinite loop with printing can break but gives
  a stray error message.

- This expression actually defines x:
  (define x (eval '(begin)))

- check syntax doesn't traverse unit or class expressions
