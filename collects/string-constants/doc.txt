_String Constants_

This library provides the facility for multiple langauges in
DrScheme's GUI. These are the exported syntactic forms and
procedures from

   (lib "string-constant.ss" "string-constants")

are
        
> (string-constant name) : string
 
   This form returns the string constant named `name'.
   
> (string-constants name) : (listof string)

  This form returns a list of string constants, one for each
  language that DrScheme's GUI supports.
  
> (this-language) : symbol

  This form returns the name of the current language
  
> (all-languages) : (listof symbol)

  This form returns a list of symbols (in the same order as
  those returned from string-constants) naming each
  language.

> (set-language-pref lang) : void

  Sets the language for the next run of DrScheme to
  lang, which must be a symbol returned from `all-languages'.
  Does not affect the running DrScheme.
  
============================================================

To add string-constants to DrScheme, see the files:

  _english-string-constants.ss_
  _french-string-constants.ss_
  _spanish-string-constants.ss_
  _german-string-constants.ss_
  _danish-string-constants.ss_
  _italian-string-constants.ss_
  
Each file has the same format. They are each modules
in the "string-constant-lang.ss" language. The body of each
module is a finite mapping table that gives the mapping
from the symbolic name of a string constant to its
translation in the appropriate language.

The english-string-constants.ss is considered the master
file -- string constants will be set there and translated
into each of the other langauge files.  In addition, the
english-string-constants.ss file should contain hints about
the context of the strings whose symbol name might not be
clear.

============================================================

_PLTSTRINGCONSTANTS_ environment variable
_STRINGCONSTANTS_ environment variable

If either of these environment variables are set, DrScheme
shows you, during startup, which string constants are not
yet defined for each langauge. 

You can also specify which languages you are interested
in. If either environment variable is bound to a symbol (as
interpreted by `read') you see only the corresponding
language's messages. If either one is bound to a list of
symbol (again, as interpreted by `read') you see the
messages for all the languages in the list. If either is
bound to anything else, you see all of the languages.

The PLTSTRINGCONSTANTS environment variable takes precedence
of the STRINGCONSTANTS environment variaable.
