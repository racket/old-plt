Bugs
----

* MacOS: bitmaps don't print (with MacOS-specific printing)

* Windows and MacOS: "primitive" dialogs don't get closed by
  custodian-shutdown-all

* MacOS: std file dialog and print dialogs block MzScheme threads

* Unix: Clipboard client is invoked in the wrong thread/eventspace

* Need to penalize the current thread more (i.e., swap it out sooner)
  after certain primitive operations that can take a long time (e.g.,
  loading a bitmap or saving a file)

* Updating bug? (hard to reproduce): long flash, not on same line,
  update on focus-in
