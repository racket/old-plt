;; This is a sample graders file
;; The graders file should contain a list of strings.
;; Each string is the name of a grader or TA.
;; When students set up their accounts, they will be allowed
;; to choose a grader from the list.
;; When homework is submitted, the files will be placed
;; into subdirectories according to their chosen grader.
