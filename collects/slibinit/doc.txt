_SLIB_ Initialization File
--------------------------

The "init.ss" file in the _slibinit_ collection is an SLIB (version
2c5) initialization file. Thus, to configure MzScheme for SLIB, load:

  (require-library "init.ss" "slibinit")

That's enough if the SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is
defined. Otherwise, MzScheme's initialization file assumes that SLIB
is installed as an "slib" collection (i.e., an "slib" directory in the
same location as the "mzlib" directory).

There is one system dependency: `most-positive-fixnum' is bound to a
32-bit-specific value. Nothing else should require changing, but send
patches to scheme@cs.rice.edu.
