variable references: there are three kinds of variable references:
1) bound variable refs
2) unit-bound variable refs
3) top-level variable refs

You might be forgiven for some confusion: these three appear to overlap 
heavily.  Here are more accurate defintions for each one:

unit-bound variable references are those which occur as the left-hand sides of 
top-level definitions within a unit.

bound variable references are those which occur within the scope of a 
lambda, case-lambda, let, let*, letrec, or other form which introduces a 
limited lexical scope.  This includes `local', but not the unit-bound 
variables mentioned above.

top-level references are the rest of the references.

One difference between top-level and bound varrefs are the way that they 
are handled at runtime.  Top-level varrefs are looked up in a table; if 
they are not found in this table, a runtime error is signalled.  Note that 
this lookup occurs only when the varref is evaluated, not when it is first 
`encountered' (e.g., in the body of a closure). One reason that this 
mechanism is necessary is that a Scheme REPL permits top-level references 
to variables that have not yet been defined.

Bound varrefs have a known lexical binding location, and they can be looked 
up directly, rather than going through the indirection of checking a table.  
These variables may be introduced by forms like `letrec' or `local', and 
they may furthermore be used before their binding definition has been 
evaluated.  In this case, they have the `<undefined>' value.  In most 
language levels, a reference to a variable which contains the `<undefined>' 
value is an error.  In such a language level, any variable which may have 
this value must be checked on every evaluated reference.

So here's the problem: unit-bound varrefs are similar to those inside a 
`local'.  Syntactically, their bindings are introduced by `define', and their 
scope extends in both directions. Semantically they are similar to 
bound variables, in that the interpreter can lexically fix the binding of 
the variable.  In both of these regards they are similar to the bindings 
in a `local'.  However, zodiac does not parse them like those in a 
`local'.  Rather, it parses them as `top-level-varref's.  Why? I forget, 
and I'm about to ask Matthew yet again.  Then I'll record the answer here.

Now things get a bit more complicated.  Top-level varrefs never need to be 
checked for the '<undefined>' value; before they are bound, they have no 
runtime lookup location at all.  Bound varrefs and unit varrefs, on the 
other hand, may contain the `<undefined>' value.  In particular, those 
bound by letrec, local, and units may contain this value.  Others, like 
those bound by lambda, let, and let*, will not.  For the first and third 
categories, we do not need to check for the undefined value at runtime.  
Only when we are looking at a bound or unit varref which may contain the 
`<undefined>' value do we need to insert a runtime check.
