This is the PLT software package directory. 

After unpacking this distribution, set the current directory to plt
(the one containing this README file) and run ./install.

Executables
-----------

The following are the executables:

  plt/bin/drscheme -- PLT's main Scheme development environment
  plt/bin/drscheme-jr -- A simple text-based DrScheme
  plt/bin/mred -- a Scheme GUI engine
  plt/bin/mzscheme -- a text-based Scheme interpreter
  plt/bin/mzc -- the MzScheme compiler

DrScheme relies on MrEd (i.e., the DrScheme executable launches
MrEd with special startup instructions), and DrScheme Jr and mzc rely
on MzScheme. You may not have some of these executables, depending
on which distribution you downloaded.

The files in plt/bin are shell scripts. The actual executable binaries
for mred and mzscheme are in plt/.bin in a platform-dependent
subdirectory. (If you have downloaded the source code distribution,
the binaries will be absent and must be compiled.) The sh scripts pick
an appropiate binary based on `uname`, so a single plt directory can
be used in a multi-platform environment. (This causes problems for
writing MzScheme scripts. See plt/notes/mzscheme/SCRIPTS for a way around
the problem.)

Compiling
---------

If you downloaded the source code distribution instead of the standard
distribution, you must compile MzScheme and MrEd before using the PLT
software (including DrScheme). 

For compilation instructions, see plt/src/mred/README and
plt/src/mzscheme/README.

If there is no plt/src/mzscheme directory, you did not download
the source code distribution. In this case, you should be ready to
run.

Documentation
-------------

Some documentation may be included in plt/collects/doc, but some of
the PLT documentation must be downloaded separately from the
executables.

HTML documentation for PLT software should be installed into
plt/collects/doc. For example, the DrScheme documenation should be in
plt/collects/doc/drscheme, with button icons in plt/collects/doc/icons.

DrScheme and MrEd will automatically add documentation installed in
plt/collects/doc to the Help menu.

Release Notes
-------------

The release notes for this version are in plt/notes/releases/51.html.
More specific notes can be found in sub-directories of plt/notes.
