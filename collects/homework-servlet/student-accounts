;; ******************** SAMPLE STUDENT ACCOUNTS ********************

;; The student accounts file should contain a (listof account)


;; There are three kinds of accounts
;;;; student-account
;;;; full-student-account
;;;; staff-account

;; ******************** STUDENTS ********************

;; The student-account is an account that has not yet been set up by the student
;; This should be the only kind of student account you will need to add/edit
;; directly in this file. Both student-accounts and full-student-accounts can be
;; managed using the staff pages.

;; To add a single new student to the system, use the staff pages by logging in
;; using a staff-account

;; To add a large number of students to the system, it may be easier to edit this file
;; directly. A student account will have the form:
;; (string string)
;; The first string is a name for the student, the second string is an ID, (usually a number).
;; E.g.: ("John Doe" "123456789")

;; When a student enters the system for the first time, she will need to set up her account
;; before she can login

;; STEPS
;; 1. From the login page select create account
;; 2. On the next page the student will be asked for a 9-digit id number
;;    The student should enter the ID for the account. E.g. John Doe
;;    would need to enter 123456789. Note this field is a password field
;;    so as to protect the student's privacy.
;; 3. On the next page the student will provide a new name and password for their
;;    account. Note, the password will be hashed before saved to disk.
;; 4. In subsequent steps the student may select a grader and a partner(s).


;; ******************** STAFF ********************

;; staff-accounts allow special priveledged users edit the accounts database
;; using a special set of web pages called "staff pages"
;; staff-accounts cannot be created using the staff pages and must be added to
;; this file by hand.

;; A staff account has the form ('staff string string)
;; The first string is the login name for the staff person, the second string
;; is an md5 hashed password string. Use md5.ss to hash the password.
;; Once the account is created, the staff person can change their password through
;; the staff pages.
;; Staff people login the same as students, but will be presented with a different
;; set of pages.

;; E.g.: (staff "Socrates" "b25146a292d56e7f39f8d5ed35572e01")
