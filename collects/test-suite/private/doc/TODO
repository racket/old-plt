I think that there is too much whitespace around the boxes, too. It'd           
be nicer to use color to separate the lines and get back some screen
"real estate".

First use experience report: Pls:                                          
                                                            
2. enable tab to move from "slot" to slot                           
                                                                                
3. make "actual" visibly different so that people know you can't fill
   it in ... :-)

One thing I noticed about your tester: it doesn't seem to use Robby's
string-constants system.  So all the menus and buttons and stuff you
have will always be in English, which will look weird to people who
use DrScheme with another language.

Make the save button come up when the program to test is changed.
Make the save button not come up when a test-suite is just loaded.
-------------------
Give a better error message with highlighting when there are too many
expressions in a test box.
-------------------
Scroll to off screen test cases when tabbing
-------------------
Don't unset the caret from a test case when a new case is inserted.
