  ;; The following two functions are used to store paths that are relative to
  ;; plthome as such in dep files.  This means that if the plt tree is moved
  ;; .dep files still work.  `plthome-ify' uses `plthome' with a hard-wired "/"
  ;; suffix, so it will not work properly if there is a different separator or
  ;; if the input path uses a directory that is equivalent to plthome but not
  ;; equal? to it.  The only processing that is performed is replacing all
  ;; backslashes with slashes on Windows.  It is generally fine if this still
  ;; misses some usages, as long as it works when we prepare a distribution
  ;; tree using a proper PLTHOME env variable.  Otherwise, things will continue
  ;; to work fine and .dep files will just contain absolute path names.  These
  ;; functions work on dep elements -- either a pathname or a pair with a
  ;; pathname in its cdr, the plthome-ified pathname will itself be a pair.
