This is the PLT software package directory. 

The standard location for this directory is:
  /usr/local/lib/plt
If this directory is elsewhere, then the environment variable PLTHOME
must be set to the path of the "plt" directory.

After unpacking this distribution, run the `install' script
in the plt directory (while the plt directory is the current
directory).

Executables
-----------

The main executables are:
  ${PLTHOME}/drscheme/drscheme    (sh script)
  ${PLTHOME}/mred/mred            (sh script)
  ${PLTHOME}/mzscheme/mzscheme    (sh script)

DrScheme relies on MrEd. You may not have some of these packages
depending on which distribution you downloaded.

The ${PLTHOME}/bin directory contains a link for each executable.

The actual executable binaries for mred and mzscheme are in mred/.bin/
and mzscheme/.bin/, respectively, in a platform-dependent
subdirectory. The sh scripts pick an appropiate binary based on
`uname`, so a single plt directory can be used in a multi-platform
environment. (This causes problems for writing MzScheme scripts. See
mzscheme/SCRIPTS for a clever trick.)

Documentation
-------------

Most of the PLT documentation must be downloaded separately from the
executables. (The exception is the DrScheme manual, which is accessed
within DrScheme through the "Help" button.)

HTML documentation for PLT software should be installed into
${PLTHOME}/doc. For example, the DrScheme documenation should be in
${PLTHOME}/doc/drscheme, with button icons in ${PLTHOME}/doc/icons.
MrEd will automatically add sections installed here to its "Help"
menu.
