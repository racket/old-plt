MysterX test control
====================

The file mystests.ss in this directory creates a window
with a test ActiveX control, and runs a number of tests on it.
After the internal tests are performed, you can interact 
with the test control using a mouse.

The C++ code in the src subdirectory is supplied uncompiled.
You need Visual C++ 6.0 to compile it.  You may need to 
change the directory for MZC in testobject.mak if you have
installed PLT software to a nonstandard location.

To compile, run "nmake".  Once you've compiled the test ActiveX 
control, load "mystests.ss".

DHTML test code
===============

The file dhtmltests.ss contains a number of tests
for the Dynamic HTML capabilities of MysterX.
Simply load the file into MzScheme or DrScheme to run the 
tests.  Any errors will be printed in the REPL.
The behavior that appears in the window that is created
may be ignored.
