This is the PLT software package folder. Setup-----Some setup is required only if you DID NOT download a Stuffit archive,you did not download the source code archive, and you did not usesuntar to unpack the .tar archive. In that case, un-MacBinary thefollowing files:   plt:DrScheme.bin   plt:Drscheme Jr.bin   plt:MrEd.XXX.bin      (needed for DrScheme)   plt:MzScheme.XXX.bin  (needed for mzc)   plt:mzc.bin   plt:collects:launcher:MzStarter.bin   plt:collects:launcher:MrStarter.binwhere "XXX" is "68k" or "PPC". You may not have some of these files, depending on which distribution you downloaded.Applications------------The following are the applications:  plt:DrScheme -- PLT's main Scheme development environment  plt:Drscheme Jr -- A simple, text-based DrScheme  plt:MrEd -- a Scheme GUI engine  plt:MzScheme -- a text-based Scheme interpreter  plt:bin:mzc -- the MzScheme compilerDrScheme relies on MrEd (i.e., the DrScheme application simplylaunches MrEd with special startup instructions), and mzc and DrSchemeJr rely on MzScheme. You may not have some of these applications,depending on which distribution you downloaded.DrScheme needs a lot of memory - at least 24MB. Give the MrEdapplication as much memory as possible for its partition (i.e., setthe application size using the "Get Info" dialog in Finder.)Compiling---------If you downloaded the source code distribution instead of the standarddistribution, you must compile MzScheme and MrEd before using the PLTsoftware (including DrScheme). For compilation instructions, unpack the Compactor archiveplt:src:cw.cpt, producing plt:src:cw. Read the ABOUT files inplt:src:cw.If there is no plt:src:mzscheme folder, you did not downloadthe source code distribution. In this case, you should be ready torun.Documentation-------------Some documentation may be included in plt:collects:doc, but some ofthe PLT documentation must be downloaded separately from theexecutables.HTML documentation for PLT software should be installed intoplt:collects:doc. For example, the DrScheme documenation should be inplt:collects:doc:drscheme, with button icons in plt:collects:doc:icons.DrScheme and MrEd will automatically add documentation installed inplt:collects:doc to the Help menu.Release Notes-------------The release notes for this version are in plt:notes:releases:51.html.More specific notes can be found in sub-directories of plt:notes.More Information----------------For more information, see  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/
