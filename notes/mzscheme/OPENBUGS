(let loop ([x 0]) (call/cc loop)) accumulates memory

"synrule.ss" is missing `let-syntax' and `letrec-syntax' and doesn't
 handle macro-in-macro interactions properly

Under Windows and Unix, a DNS lookup by tcp-connect blocks all
 MzScheme threads

Under MacOS, in the standalone MzScheme application, a blocking read 
 from stdin blocks all MzScheme threads

Under MacOS, an input expression that is longer than 256 characters
 makes the console get stuck (CodeWarrior SIOUX bug)

Under Windows, the `system' procedure blocks all MzScheme threads
 (`system*' works correctly)

Under AIX 3.2, write to tcp output port blocks MzScheme when the
  low-level buffer is full

On Alpha machines, floating-point overflow is not handled properly
 (so +inf.0, -inf.0, and +nan.0 are messed up)
