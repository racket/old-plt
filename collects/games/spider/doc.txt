** To play _Spider_, run the "Games" application. **

Spider is a solitare card game played with 104 cards. The cards can
include either a single suit, two suits, or four suites. (Choose your
variant through the "Options" item in the "Edit" menu.)

Terminology:

 * Tableau: one of the ten stacks of cards in the play area. The game
   starts with six cards in the first four tableaus, and five cards in
   the rest; only the topmost card is face up, and others are revealed
   when they become the topmost card of the tableau.

 * Sequence: a group of cards on the top of a tableau that are in the
   same suit, and that are in sequence, with the lowest numbered card
   topmost (i.e., closer to the bottom of the screen). King is high
   and ace is low.

The object of the game is to create a sequence with ace through king,
at which point the sequence is removed from play. Create eight such
sequences to win the game.

On each move, you can either:

 * Move a sequence from any tableau to one whose topmost card (i.e.,
   closest to the bottom of the screen) has a value that's one more
   than the sequence's value. Note that if the top card of the target
   tableau has the same suit as the sequence, a larger sequence is
   formed, but the target tableau's card is not required to have the
   same suit.

 * Move a sequence to an empty tableau.

 * Deal ten cards from the deck (in the upper left corder), one to
   each tableau. This move is allowed only if no tableau is empty.

To move a sequence, either drag it to the target tableau, or click the
sequence and then click the top card of the target tableau (or the
place where a single card would be for an empty tableau). Click a
select card to de-select it. Clicking a card that is not a valid
target for the currently selected sequence causes the clicked card's
sequence to be selected (if the card is face up in a sequence).

To deal, click the deck.

To undo a move, use "Undo" from the "Edit" menu.
