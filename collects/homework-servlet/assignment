;; here's an assignment entry:
(assignment (title "Test Assignment"
                   "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/211-f03/assignments.html")	
            (due-date (year 2010)
                      (month 1)
                      (day 1)))

;; additional date fields such as seconds, minutes are also supported.
;; if not specified, reasonable defaults are used.

;; When the assignment is not yet overdue, an upload link appears to the right
;; of the assignment on the selection page.

;; The URL part of the title can be omitted. When it is omitted, the title simply
;; appears as text. When it is not omitted the title will link to the page specified by
;; the URL.

;; There should be exactly one assignment entry in the assignment file
