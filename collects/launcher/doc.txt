(make-mred-launcher args dest) - Creates the launcher `dest'. The `dest'
   executeable will start MrEd with the command-line arguments
   specified as strings in the list `args'. Extra arguments
   passed to the launcher at run-time will be appended to this
   list and passed on to MrEd.

   `make-mred-launcher' transforms `args as necessary to avoid
   mutations caused by passing the strings through the
   platform-specific launching mechanism (e.g, as sh arguments), so
   the strings in `flags' arrive to MrEd intact.

(make-mzscheme-launcher args dest) - Same as `make-mred-launcher',
   but for starting MzScheme.

(make-mred-program-launcher collection dest) - Calls
   `make-mred-launcher' with arguments that start the MrEd program
   implemednted by `collection': (list "-A" collection "--").
    

(make-mzscheme-program-launcher file collection dest) - Calls
   `make-mzscheme-launcher' with arguments that start the MzScheme
   program implemented by `file' in `collection': (list "-mvL-"
   file collection)

(install-mred-program-launcher collection name) - Calls
   `make-mred-launcher' with the standard destination for
   executables in the current PLT home directory. `name' is
   used as the executable name. (The ".exe" suffix is automatically
   appended for Windows.)

(install-mzscheme-program-launcher file collection name) - Calls
   `make-mzscheme-launcher' with the standard desitnation for
   executables in the current PLT home directory. `name' is
   used as the executable name. (The ".exe" suffix is automatically
   appended for Windows.)
