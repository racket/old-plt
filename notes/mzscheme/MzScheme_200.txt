MzScheme version 200 is different from previous versions of MzScheme
in several important ways:

 * There is a new module system that supports only top-level,
   first-order modules. The library-collection system now works with
   the module system. In particular, `require-library' has been
   replaced by `import'.

 * There is no built-in object or unit system. These have been moved
   to externally defined syntax modules: "class.ss", "unit.ss", and
   "unitsig.ss" in the "mzlib" collection. For example, to get the old
   class system, use `(import (lib "class.ss"))'.

 * The core syntax system is "hygienic"; `define-macro' has been
   replaced by `define-syntax'.

   In general, there is no easy way to convert a `define-macro' macro
   to `define-syntax'; re-writing an old-style macro with
   `define-syntax' and `syntax-case' is usually quite easy.

 * All #% names are gone, since they are unnecessary with the new
   syntax system.
