To play _Pousse_, run the "Games" application.

Pousse (French for "push", pronounced "poo-ss") is a 2 person game,
played on an N by N board (usually 4x4).  Initially the board is
empty, and the players take turns inserting one marker of their color
(X or O) on the board.  The color X always goes first.  The columns
and rows are numbered from 1 to N, starting from the top left, as in:

     1 2 3 4
    +-+-+-+-+
  1 | | | | |
    +-+-+-+-+
  2 | | | | |
    +-+-+-+-+
  3 | | | | |
    +-+-+-+-+
  4 | | | | |
    +-+-+-+-+

A marker can only be inserted on the board by sliding it onto a
particular row from the left or from the right, or onto a particular
column from the top or from the bottom.  So there are 4*N possible
"moves" (ways to insert a marker).  They are be named "Li", "Ri",
"Ti", "Bi" respectively, where "i" is the number of the row or column
where the insertion takes place.

When a marker is inserted, there may be a marker on the square where
the insertion takes place.  In this case, all markers on the insertion
row or column from the insertion square upto the first empty square
are moved one square further to make room for the inserted marker.
Note that the last marker of the row or column will be pushed off the
board (and must be removed from play) if there are no empty squares on
the insertion row or column.

A row or a column is a "straight" of a given color, if it contains
N markers of the given color.

The game ends either when an insertion

1) repeats a previous configuration of the board; in this case
   the player who inserted the marker LOSES.

2) creates a configuration with more straights of one color than
   straights of the other color; the player whose color is dominant
   (in number of straights) WINS.

A game always leads to a win by one of the two players.  Draws are
impossible.
