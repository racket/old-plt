MrEd Engine:

* Motif: pre-on-char doesn't work for sliders (therefore, frame/dialog
  navagation doesn't work when a slider has the focus)

* MacOS: bitmaps don't print with platform-specific printing

* Need to penalize the current thread more for certain primitive
   operations that can take a long time (e.g., loading a bitmap
   or saving a file)

* Need directory-selection dialog

* Keys like KP_end, etc. are not currently accessible

* Windows and MacOS: "primitive" dialogs don't get closed by
   custodian-shutdown-all

* MacOS: std file dialog and print dialogs block MzScheme threads

* editor: the full width for non-wrapped lines need not include the autowrap bitmap

* editor: should use a guaranteed offset for stippling in buffer redraws

* Xt: out-of-colours - widgets use too much black

* hidden files in Windows cause problems? Add a MzScheme predicate?

* optimization: dragging selection shouldn't keep changing the auto-X-selection

* add background color for buffers?

* updating bug?: long flash, not on same line, update on focus-in

* add paragraph styles?

* need better de-fragmentation of text snips

* need to show a mystery snip icon when unknown data is loaded from a file
