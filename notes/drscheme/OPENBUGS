- check syntax doesn't traverse unit or class expressions

- check syntax: identifiers with newlines in them have their arrows
  start from funny places.

- check syntax's alpha renaming does not work for "define-struct".

- even if breaking is turned off, read will still be breakable. Eg:
  (dynamic-disable-break (lambda () (read)))

- the yellow execute warning in the interactions window does not go
  away if the user undoes their changes to the defintions window.

- backup files don't preserve file permissions
