compile.ss
----------

`compile-extension' takes
   quiet? - Boolean indicating whether command should be echoed to stdout
   input-file - A .c file
   output-file - A .o/.obj file
   includes - A list of include directories; MzScheme's include is
              added automatically.

Compilation is controlled by a number of parameters:

   current-extension-compiler - compiler executable or #f. Under 
     Windows, #f looks for cl.exe using the PATH env. variable.
     Under Unix, #f looks for gcc and then cc.

   current-extension-compiler-flags - list of strings. Under Windows,
    the default is (list "/c" "/O2"); (list "-c" "-O2") for Unix

   current-make-compile-include-strings - procedure that takes an
    include dir and returns a list of strings for the command line.
    Windows: "dir" -> (list "\Idir"); Unix: "dir" -> (list "-Idir")

   current-make-compile-input-strings - procedure that takes an
    input file and returns a list of strings for the command line.
    The default is `list'.

   current-make-compile-output-strings - procedure that takes an
    output file and returns a list of strings for the command line.
    Windows: "file"->(list "\Fofile"); Unix: "file"->(list "-o" "file")

link.ss
-------

`link-extension' takes:
   quiet? - Boolean indicating whether command should be echoed to stdout
   input-files - A list of .o files
   output-file - A .so/.dll file

Linking parameters:

   current-extension-linker - linker executable or #f. Under 
     Windows, #f looks for cl.exe using the PATH env. variable.
     Under Unix except AIX, #f looks for ld. Under AIX, #f looks
     for cc.

   current-extension-linker-flags - list of strings. Under Windows,
     default is (list "/LD"). Unix default varies greatly per-platform.

   current-make-link-input-strings - procedure that takes an
     input file and returns a list of strings for the command line.
     The default is `list'.

   current-make-link-output-strings - procedure that takes an
    output file and returns a list of strings for the command line.
    Windows: "file"->(list "\Fefile"); Unix: "file"->(list "-o" "file")

   current-standard-link-libraries - list of file paths; For
    most platforms, the default is 
     (list (build-path (collection-path "mzscheme" "lib") 
                       (system-library-subpath)
                       "mzdyn.o"))

file.ss
-------

 (make-directory* dir) - makes dir, creating intermediate directoies
   if necessary. If there is an error, and exception is raised.

 (append-object-suffix s) - appends the platform-standard object
   file suffix to s

 (append-extension-suffix s) - appends the platform-standard dynamic
   extension file suffix to s
