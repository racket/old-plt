Version 101:

  We decided to eliminate the terminology "teaching library",
  because it is easily confused with a plain library. As of release 101, we
  refer to one of these objects as a

    teachpack

  The teachpacks are found at 

    $PLTHOME/teachpack/
    PLTHOME is the location of the PLT software

  This directory contains only those files that matter to students. All
  others are now placed in a collection (regular library). 

  Inside of DrScheme, the menu choice called "Language|Set library to..."
  is now called "Language|Set teachpack to...". 

  * CHANGES in individual files: The most important and most visible change
  in the teachpack support concerns the

    hangman.ss for implementing hangman 

  teachpack. It provides two interfaces: _hangman_ for three-letter words
  and _hangman-list_ for words of arbitrary length. In both cases, the
  teachpack now implements the player who picks a word that the other,
  human player needs to guess. Students implement the procedures for making
  words, comparing words, and drawing the hangman figure.

  The teachpack 

    master.ss for implementing a simple version of MasterMind 

  now exports the procedure _master_, which is exactly like the procedure
  _repl_ in the old master-lib.ss library. 

  No other interface has been changed. The corresponding exercises in How
  to Design Programs have been rewritten and will be posted on the HtDP 
  Web site. 

  Also see the documentation of the teachpacks in HelpDesk. Just type in 
  the name of the teachpack or follow the links from the HelpDesk top-level 
  page. 

  INTERFACE: The interface to teachpacks is the same as that to libraries: 
  
    plt:userspace^

  If, in the past, you wrote your own teaching libraries, they should work 
  without any problem. We recommend you put them in a directory parallel to 
  teachpack/htdp/. 

  REMINDER: The purpose of teachpacks is to supplement student programs
  with code that is beyond the teaching languages (Beginner, Intermediate,
  Advanced). For example, to enable students to play hangman, we supply a
  teachpack that 
    - implements the random choosing of a word 
    - maintains the state variable of how many guesses have gone wrong 
    - manages the GUI. 
  All these tasks are beyond students in the third week and/or impose
  nothing memorization of currently useless knowledge on students. 

Version 100:

The plt:userspace^ signature does not contain the
graphics library. In order to use the graphics library in your
teachpacks, use a compound unit and link in graphics directly. For example:

  (require-library "graphics.ss" "graphics")
  
  (define-signature my-teachpack^ (four))
  
  (define my-teachpack
    (unit/sig my-teachpack^
      
      (import plt:userspace^ 
              graphics^)
      
      '...
      
      (define four 4)))
  
  (compound-unit/sig 
   (import [P : plt:userspace^])
   (link [G : graphics^ ((require-library "graphicr.ss" "graphics")
                         (P : mzlib:file^)
                         (P : mred^))]
         [TP : my-teachpack^ (my-teachpack P G)])
   (export (open TP)))

The graphics^ signature contains all of the primitives in the
graphic.ss library. Search for "graphics" in Help Desk for more
information on those primitives.
