;			HTML Authoring in SXML
;
; The present file defines and demonstrates a function SXML->HTML, the
; most generic transformation of SXML into the corresponding HTML
; document. The SXML tree is traversed post-order and converted into
; another tree, which, written in a depth-first fashion, results in a
; HTML document. The function SXML->HTML can generate an arbitrary
; HTML markup, for any existing or yet to be introduced HTML
; tag. Furthermore, the function supports one higher-level tag,
; 'html:begin'. As the source code below indicates, SXML->HTML can be
; trivially extended to support other higher-level tags.
;
; The proper HTML markup is being created by a set of node
; handlers. An iterator 'post-order' executes these functions while it
; traverses an SXML tree.
;
; Each node handler takes a tag (the head of an SXML node) and the
; list of children nodes, if any. A handler returns a fragment or a
; list of HTML fragments -- which become arguments to a handler of a
; parent SXML node.  A function SRV:send-reply takes the resulting
; tree of fragments and writes out the fragments in a depth-first
; order. The output is an HTML document that corresponds to the
; original SXML tree.
;
; This pretty-printing operation  makes it possible to author and
; compose HTML documents in their SXML form. SXML is more concise and
; expressive than a raw markup language. SXML representing regular
; Scheme code can be entered in any Scheme-sensitive editor. SXML as a
; data structure -- a list -- can likewise be composed as a literal or
; quasi-literal expression. Furthermore, SXML can be produced by regular
; Scheme functions, which may make authoring more succinct, advanced,
; and less tedious, as the code below illustrates.
