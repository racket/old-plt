There is no caddr_t in djgpp 2.01 so the following declaration was added to
os_dep.c. It may need to be removed for other versions.

	typedef caddr_t long unsigned int;


Use Makefile.dj to compile it :

	C> make -f Makefile.dj test


!!! setjmp_t.exe works fine.
!!! gctest.exe works fine.
!!! cordtest.exe fail.
!!! test_cpp.exe works fine.

In some cases it may be necessary to explicitly set GC_stackbottom.
