MrEd Engine:

* wx:item%'s get-label includes & in names on some platforms,
  strips & for others

* Motif: pre-on-char doesn't work for sliders

* Windows: pre-on-char doesn't work for input that moves
   the focus between controls (e.g., cursor keys)

* MacOS needs way to control the 0-window menu bar

* MacOS: bitmaps don't print with platform-specific printing

* X Windows and drawing into b & w bitmaps: black and white
   are reversed when using certain kinds of displays

* wx:dc%'s draw-arc is undefined when input isn't
   consistent with a circle

* Windows: set-user-scale with wx:memory-dc% doesn't work right

* need to penalize the current thread more for certain primitive
   operations that can take a long time (e.g., loading a bitmap
   or saving a file)

* need directory-selection dialog

* Keys like KP_end, etc. are not currently accessible

* doc: [Mr] clarify "owning the caret" with respect to ownership by the parent, etc.

* Motif: built-in get-file dialog modality is wrong for eventspaces

* Windows and MacOS: "primitive" dialogs don't get closed by
   custodian-shutdown-all

* MacOS: std file dialog and print dialogs block MzScheme threads

* how does wx:dc% get-size interact with the user scale?

* the full width for non-wrapped lines need not include the autowrap bitmap

* should use a guranteed offset for stippling in buffer redraws

* Xt: out-of-colours - widgets use too much black

* hidden files in Windows cause problems? Add a MzScheme predicate?

* optimization: dragging selection shouldn't keep changing the auto-X-selection

* Xt: busy cursor not shown in the menu bar

* a blinking caret would be nice

* Motif: menus don't work with multiple displays

* Motif: wxDialogBox doesn't obey current display for multiple displays

* add background colour for buffers?

* updating bug?: long flash, not on same line, update on focus-in

* add paragraph styles?

* need better de-fragmentation of text snips

* need to show a mystery snip icon when unknown data is loaded from a file

==========================================================================

MrEd System:

- replace can't replace with an empty string (ie, deleting
  a word by finding it and replacing it with empty doesn't work)

- bad url's are not handled smoothly

- mred:console%'s initialization argument: `close-item?' is being ignored

- backup files don't preserve permissions

- the directory line in the common-file-dialogs is confusing

- embedded snips should be reset on the styles-fixed? ivar

- "scale" in open-viewport does effect the size
  of the viewport, but is ignored by at least
  draw-line into that viewport.
	
- pathnames should be normalized to early and can cause automouter problems

- control-l doesn't get the horizontal direction right.
