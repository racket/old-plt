Here's a few things I need to add to the wxMac161d-a4p4 release

1. in wx_gdi.cc, make sure cMacCursor is null:

wxCursor::wxCursor(int cursor_type)
{
  __type = wxTYPE_CURSOR;
  cMacCursor = NULL;

2. in wx_app, doMacKeyDown(), Matt says to HNoPurge the resource:
    default:
      if (!transH) {
		transH = GetIndResource('KCHR', 1);
		HNoPurge(transH);
      }

3. in wx_xbm.cc, GETLINE(), we need to return a value (compiler warning):
	if (pos < size)
		b[pos] = 0;
	return pos;

4. in wx_menu.cc ~wxMenu, I would get crashes on hello sample but not others.
   comment out the if (title) delete[] title; since wxbMenu now gets these.
   
	::DisposeMenu(cMacMenu); // WCH: does this dispose of submenus? I hope not.
                             // mflatt: it does not dispose of submenus

	// if (title) delete[] title; // WCH: ~wxbMenu should do this - (cjc - it does)
	wxNode* node = menuItems.First();

5. in wxLabelArea.cc , constructor, I add 5 to the width of a horizontal Label so that
   labels do not butt up against the control. This hack *used* to be in GetTextExtent.
   This is a more appropriate place.

	else
	{
		SetMargin(labelWidth+5, Direction::wxLeft);
	}
