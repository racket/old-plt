The object of _Paint By Numbers_ is to discover which cells should be
colored blue and which should be colored white. Initially, all squares are
grey, indicating that the correct colors are not known. The lists of
numbers to the left and above the grid are your clues to the correct color
of each square. Each list of numbers specifies the pattern of blue squares
in the row beside it or the column below it. Each number indicates the
length of a group of blue squares. For example, if the list of numbers
beside the first row is "2 3" then you know that there is a contiguous
block of two blue squares followed by a contiguous block of three blue
squares with at least one white square between them. The label does not
tell you where the blue squares are, only their shapes. The trick is to
gather as much information as you can about each row, and then use that
information to determine more about each column. Eventually you should be
able to fill in the entire puzzle.

Click on a square to toggle it between gray and blue. Hold down a modifier
key (shift, command, meta, or alt depending on the platform) to toggle a
square between white and gray. For some puzzles, hints are
available. Choose the Nongram|Show Mistakes menu item to receive the
hints. This will turn all incorrectly colored squares red.
