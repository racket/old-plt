WBUILD
======

Wbuild is a program for easier creating of X widgets. It reads
abbreviated code from a file and expands it with the boilerplate code
that every widget must have. It also generates the documentation.

Wbuild is a tool for the widget writer. It has three goals: (1) making
widget writing easier, (2) making it more object-oriented, and (3)
encouraging `literate programming'.  It does this in the same way that
yacc helps in writing compilers: it lets the programmer write code
that is close to the concepts in his head. With yacc the concept is
grammar-rules, with Wbuild it is OOP.

The input to Wbuild is an object-oriented description of a widget.
There are sections for private and public variables, methods, private
functions, etc. But all the structs, macros, header files and
functions that are needed to trick C into object-orientedness remain
hidden. Inheritance is automatic, which means that one has to write
only the code that makes a widget different from its superclass. Even
the manual is created automatically.  Documentation can be written
directly into the source. Documentation and code are formatted
together with nroff or TeX.

You may need to install bison and/or flex if you encounter problems.
