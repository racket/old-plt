DRSCHEME TOOLS/LIBRARIES HISTORY
--------------------------------
Version 51:
 - tools must now import wx names explicitly, as a new first import.

 - the parameters interface has changed. Instead getting and setting
   the class, the tool programmer must register a function that
   accepts a class and returns a class. See the manual for more
   details.

 - process/zodiac-finish has been renamed to process-finish
