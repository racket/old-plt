_Slib_ Initialization File
--------------------------

The "init.ss" file in the _slibinit_ collection is an slib2c5
initialization file. To configure MzScheme for slib, load:

  (require-library "init.ss" "slibinit")

That's enough if the SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is
defined. Otherwise, the initialization file assumes that slib is
installed as an "slib" collection (i.e., in an "slib" directory in the
same location as the "mzlib" directory).


The initialization file contains one system-dependent setting:
`most-positive-fixnum' is bound to a value that is precisely correct
for 32-bit architectures. The precise value for a 64-bit architcture
is in the file, but commented out. The only danger in using the 32-bit
value for a 64-bit architecture is a decrease in performance.

No other changes should be necessary. Send patches to
scheme@cs.rice.edu.
