 MINOR CHANGES AND BUG FIXES
 
 - when the framework collection has a "CVS" subdirectory, 
   drscheme shows the current memory usage in the info panel.
   Clicking the button performs three gcs and updates the memory count.

 - bug submission form's severity choice now defaults to "serious"
   instead of "critical".

 - bug submission form now inclues the installed manuals.

 - Bug reports can now be submitted using Help Desk. Please use this
   in favor of the emacs or web-based submission, if possible.
   [Steck's PR was premature; none of those problems exist]

 FUNCTIONALITY CHANGES
 
 - gui-utils:get-choice does now allow cancelling or closing
   of the dialog. The user is forced to actually choose one of
   the two buttons.
 
 - all c:[ bindings are now gone. Use esc or meta
   (alt on some platforms) instead
 
 - editor:basic-mixin no longer has a `default-auto-wrap?' method.
   Just set the parameter method `auto-wrap' directly.
 
   
 MINOR CHANGES AND BUG FIXES
   
 - fixed a bug in help desk where help desk would try to open a
   doc.txt/doc.txt file.
 
 - rgb-red, rgb-blue, and rgb-green fixed (and added to test suite)
 
 - collects/browser/html.ss now has a separate non-breaking space 
   snip that it uses instead of regular spaces for &nbsp;

 - the page that help desk leads to when an installed html page is
   accessed now explains what to do for proxy server users.
   [Shriram: is the explanation satisfactory?]
   
 - changed the bahavior of esc-space and esc-\. They should not
   generate any error messages anymore, but they may not
   be quite the same as they used to. Please try them and see if
   you don't like the changes.

 - PRS: 1154, 1133,

 - Parenthesis highlighting now turns unmatched parens red
   in addition to turning matched parenthesis regions grey.
   Also (now that the caret flashes) if the caret is between two
   parens, both before and after parens will be highlighted,
   not just the ones before.
   
   Thus, every time the cursor is next to an uncommented
   paren, the programmer sees some feedback about the paren.
 
 - PR 1112 (matthew's submission). I cannot reject the bad preference
   at drscheme startup (so drscheme will have this "badfont") 
   without searching for all of the fixed with fonts on every
   startup of drscheme. So, I only reject the preference when the
   preferences dialog is opened. I hope that this is satisfactory.

 - If you set your language to be mred or mzscheme in 100 and then use
   this version, instead of an internal error being raised (becuase
   there is no mred language level anymore) the language we be
   reset back to Beginner.

 - Changed the language dialog as specified in the meeting minutes. 
   Comments, please.
 
 - Using Save As when a filename has already been selected causes the 
   standard file dialog to initially contain that name.

 - The old Configure Language menu item is now called "Choose Language".		

; ------------------------------------------------------------


101d1

 - An undocumented version of the new turtles is now available.
   It supports everything the old turtles did, but now the turtle
   window is a value. Set your library to PLT/lib/turtle.ss and try
   the following program in the stepper! (there is a font problem in
   the stepper, related to the turtles; we know) More info about the
   new turtles is below the program.

(define (draw-sides n theta side-len tv)
  (cond
    [(zero? n) tv]
    [else
     (draw-sides
      (sub1 n)
      theta
      side-len
      (turn/radians
       theta
       (draw side-len tv)))]))

(define (regular-poly sides radius tv)
  (merge
   (clean
    (draw-sides
     sides
     (/ pi 1/2 sides)
     (* 2 radius (sin (/ pi sides)))
     (turn/radians
      (+ (/ pi 2) (/ pi sides))
      (move
       radius
       tv))))
   tv))

(regular-poly 5 30 (turtles 70 70))


   added value-turtler.ss, value-turtles.ss, value-turtle.ss,
   and value-turtle-lib.ss to the graphics collection and
   turtle.ss to PLT/lib

   All of the basic turtle commands (turn, move,
   draw, turn/radians) accept an extra argument, the turtles, and
   produce a new turtle picture. 

   (turtles X Y) produces a new turtle value of size X by Y.

   Split and prompt are gone; they are replaced by merge and clean.
   Clean accepts a turtles and erases all of the turtles in it,
   leaving behind the drawing.

   Merge accepts two turtle values. It result is a
   turtle value whose drawing comes from the first argument and whose
   turtles come from the concatenation of both argument's turtles.
   For example,

   (merge (draw 50 (turtles 170 40))
          (draw 50 (turn 180 (turtles 170 40))))

   Is a turtle value with two turtles pointing in opposite directions,
   100 pixels apart, but with only a single 50 pixel line between
   them.

Version 100:

General
-------

 - DrScheme's languages have changed. The new languages are:

    - Beginner
    - Intermediate
    - Advanced
    - MzScheme
    - MrEd

   The first three languages are essentially the same as in version
   53, except that graphics primitives have been removed. (Instead,
   domain-specific graphics commands can be loaded as libraries.) The
   turtles remain in the advanced language.

   The MzScheme and MrEd languages match exactly the languages
   provided by the MzScheme and MrEd executables.

 - A simple algebraic stepper, dubbed The Foot, is now available.  The
   Foot permits users to construct a source-level evaluation trace for
   programs written in the Beginner language. It will be expanded in
   future releases.

 - DrScheme's Help Desk provides online help for DrScheme, its
   languages, and its libraries.

 - Graphics functions were removed from the teaching languages
   (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced), except Turtles in
   Advanced. To use graphics functions, you must select a library (and
   the teaching libraries are not yet updated).

 - The old viewport-based graphics library can be loaded into the MrEd
   Debug language via (require-library "graphic.ss" "graphics").

 - I/O within DrScheme is substantially improved.

 - The library and tool interfaces for extended DrScheme have
   changed.


Version 53:

General
-------

 - view menu items now have accelerators

 - (<= exp) isn't allowed in beginner. (same for <, >, and >=)

 - print primitive is now setup correctly to print based on the language level

 - paren-matching in semi-colon comments is disabled

 - info panel "running" message is now aligned correctly 
 
 - The check synatax and analyze buttons are now disabled during evaluation

 - library directory now starts in "MZLIB_COLLECTS_DIR/../../lib"
   which is our best approximation to "PLTHOME/lib"
 
 - elevator library can now select more than one floor at a time


Version 52:

General
-------

- The words "running" or "not running" at the bottom of the
  DrScheme frame indicate whether or not work is happening in the 
  user's program. 

- a "Windows" menu has been added which keeps track of the currently
  open drscheme windows.

- the source locations for "load"ed files now match the numbers 
  in the bottom of the drscheme window.

- the thread that evaluations (including execution) take place on is
  the same as the eventspace's main thread, unless the evaluation
  thread is killed. In that case, the eventspace's main thread is
  re-generated, but the execution thread does not.

- The REPL implementation has been cleaned up.

- the turtles window does not survive across executions anymore

- the Quasi-R4RS language level has been renamed to R4RS+

DrScheme Tools/Libraries
------------------------

- new methods on rep:edit%: report-exception-error accepts an exception and
  prints the error message in the console.

- send-scheme is outdated. Use run-in-evaluation-thread instead

- the drscheme:tool^ signature has changed. A new subunit, "basis" has
  been aded and the process-finish struct is now in that subunit. So,
  drscheme:language:process-finish? becomes
  drscheme:basis:process-finish?, etc.
  
  The process-finish structure no longer has a boolean indicating sucess. 
  Instead, an exception is raised.


- the settings for the language have been re-aranged
  - there are two new parameters, exported from the basis
    subunit of drscheme:export^, current-setting and current-vocabulary
    - current-vocabulary contains the vocabulary that zodiac uses to
      perform macro expansion
    - current-setting is bound to a setting struct, which encapsulates
      all of the information about the language level
  - the process-*/zodiac and process-*/no-zodiac proceudres
    are no longer methods and their arguments have changed


Version 51:

General 
-------
- fixed error message for "eq?" and "cons" at beginner level.

- check syntax does not work with an unitialized repl when:
  the source contains define-macro. (won't be fixed in the release)

- eval no longer loops forever in mred vocabulary 

- searching keybindings have changed. There are four distinct actions:
   action1: move keyboard focus to the searching window, opening it if necessary, 
            or if already there search forward
   action2: move keyboard focus to the searching window, opening it if necessary, 
            or if already there search backward.
   action3: search again, in the same direction
   action4: move the focus between the main window, searching window and replacment window
   action5: hide the searching window

The actions are mapped to different keys, based on the platform. 

On unix:
 action1 => control-s, meta-%
 action2 => control-r
 action3 => f3
 action4 => control-i
 action5 => control-g

On the macintosh:
  action1 => command-f
  action2 => command-r
  action3 => command-g
  action4 => command-o
  action5 => command-.

On windows:
 action1 => control-f
 action2 => control-r
 action3 => f3, control-g
 action4 => control-i
 action5 => escape

- turned off the file name printouts on splash screen

  evaluate: 
  (wx:write-resource "mred" "splashMessages" 1 (wx:find-path 'setup-file))
  to turn them back on.

- fixed a bug that caused error messages to be displayed in message
  boxes more often than neccessary. (as opposed to printing in the
  repl)

- parenthesis matching is improved

- The empty list is now called "empty" instead of "null" with the
  constructor style printer.

- The analyze button puts up a dialog saying "please wait, loading",
  now.

- the fonts dialog now shows previews of the selected fonts. You
  still need to restart to see the changes, unfortunately.

DrScheme Tools/Libraries
------------------------

- tools must now import wx names explicitly, as a new first import.

- the parameters interface has changed. Instead getting and setting
  the class, the tool programmer must register a function that
  accepts a class and returns a class. See the manual for more
  details.

- process/zodiac-finish has been renamed to process-finish
