The following is a summary of the changes in this release
from the previous one.

<h4> DrScheme </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Non-text items (e.g. a picture) can be used in a program as a contant
value. The interaction window handles non-text for both input and
output. When non-text is used in a program saved to disk, the file is
automatically saved to disk in DrScheme's binary format.

<li> 
Syntax checking has been improved, and the colors are
now parameterized through preferences.

<li> 
These syntactic forms not yet supported:<tt> </tt>
do without the step form and define-structure (use define-struct instead).

</ul>

<h4> Analysis </h4>

<ul>
<li>
The Analysis tool (MrSpidey) is temporarily unavailable in 
release 44 and will reappear in a future release.
</ul>

<h4> Known Problems </h4>

<ul>
<li>
DrScheme internally normalizes pathnames, resolving all links
to absolute paths. This causes problems with systems that use
automounting.

<li>
Even in the R4RS language level, DrSchemd does not support 
case-insensitive identifiers.

<li>
The <tt>eval</tt> procedure is not supported.
</ul>
