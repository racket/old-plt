                          _graph.ss_

[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]

The graph.ss library provides a graph drawing toolkit, built
out of mred's pasteboard%s.

In provides four exports: graph-snip<%>, graph-snip-mixin,
graph-pasteboard<%>, graph-pasteboard-mixin, and add-links.

============================================================

The _graph-pasteboard<%>_ interface has one method:

> (send a-graph-pasteboard<%> on-mouse-over-snips a-los)
  a-los : (listof snip%)

This method is called when the mouse passes over any snips
in the editor. It is only called when the list of snips
under the editor changes (ie, if the mouse moves, but
remains over the same list of snips, the method is not
called). Also, this method is called with the empty list if
the mouse leaves the pasteboard.

> (send a-graph-pasteboard<%> set-arrowhead-params angle-width short-side long-size)

Sets drawing parameters for the arrowhead. The first is the
angle of the arrowhead's point, in radians. The second is
the length of the outside line of the arrowhead and the last
is the distance from the arrohead's point to the place where
the arrowhead comes together.

> (send a-graph-pasteboard<%> get-arrowhead-params) -> (values number number number)

Returns the current settings for the arrowhead's drawing.

The _graph-pasteboard-mixin_ overrides many methods to draw
lines between graph-snip<%>s that it contains and
implements the graph-pasteboard<%> interface.

============================================================

The _graph-snip<%>_ interface has these methods:

> (send a-graph-snip<%> get-children) - returns a list of
   snips that implement graph-snip<%>. Each of these snips
   will have a line drawn from it, pointing at this snip.

> (send a-graph-snip<%> add-child (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)) -
  adds a child of this snip. Instead of calling this method,
  consider using the add-child function provided from this
  library. 

> (send a-graph-snip<%> remove-child (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)) - 
  removes a child snip from this snip. Be sure to remove this
  snip as a parent from the argument, too.
  

> (send a-graph-snip<%> get-parents) - returns a list of
  snips that implement graph-snip<%>. Each of these
  snips will have a line drawn to it, starting from this
  snip. 

> (send a-graph-snip<%> add-parent (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>))
> (send a-graph-snip<%> add-parent (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)
                                   (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
                                   (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
                                   (union false? (is-a?/c brush%))
                                   (union false? (is-a?/c brush%)))
  adds a parent of this snip. Instead of calling this method,
  consider using the add-links function provided from this
  library. 

> (send a-graph-snip<%> remove-parent)
  removes a parent snip from this snip. Be sure to remove this
  snip as a child from the argument, too.

> (send a-graph-snip<%> get-parent-links) - this method is
  only used internally. It returns a list of opaque
  structures that contain information about the parent snips
  and what color the links between them should be.

============================================================

The _graph-snip-mixin_ adds the graph-snip<%> functionality
to a snip%.

============================================================

The _add-links_ function connects a parent snip to a child
snip in the same pasteboard.

> (add-links (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>) (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>))
> (add-links (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>) 
             (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)
             (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c brush%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c brush%)))
> (add-links (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>) 
             (is-a?/c graph-snip<%>)
             (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c pen%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c brush%))
             (union false? (is-a?/c brush%))
             (union false? number?)
             (union false? number?))

When called with two arguments, connects the snips using a
blue/purple color scheme for the links. The first snip is
the parent and the second snip is the child.

When called with four arguments, uses the two pens and
brushes for the color scheme. The first pen and the first
brush are used when the mouse cursor is over the snip
(or a child or parent) and the second pen and brush are used
when the mouse cursor is not over the snip. The brush is used to
draw inside the arrow head and the pen is used to draw the
border of the arrowhead and the line connecting the two
snips.

The final arguments are dx and dy offsets for the head
and the tail of the arrow,  first dx and then dy.

                     _name-message.ss_

[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]


The _name-message%_ class is derived from canvas%. It
overrides the on-paint and on-event methods to draw the name
of a file and handle clicks to popup a menu for choosing a
directory.

> (send a-name-message set-message file-name? msg)

  file-name? : boolean
  msg : string

If file-name? is #t, msg is treated like a pathname and
clicks on the name message objects popup a menu that opens a
get-file dialog.

If file-name is #f, msg is treated as a regular
string. Clicking on the name message pops up a dialog saying
that there is no file name until the file is saved.
      
> (send a-name-message on-choose-directory dir)

  dir : string

This method is called when one of the popup menu items is
chosen. The argument is a string representing the specified
directory.

============================================================

> (calc-button-min-sizes dc string) 

Calculates the minimum width and height of a button label
(when drawn with draw-button-label). Returns two values: the
width and height.

============================================================

> (draw-frame-button-label dc label width height inverted)

Draws a button label like the one for the (define ...) and
filename buttons in the top-left corner of the DrScheme

frame. Use this function to draw similar buttons. The basic
idea is to create a canvas object whose on-paint method is
overridden to call this function.  The dc should be canvas's
dc object, the label should be the string to display on the
button.  The width and height arguments should be the width
and height of the button and inverted? should be #t when the
button is being depressed.

See calc-button-min-sizes for help calculating the min sizes
of the button.

                     _plot.ss_

[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]

plot.ss provides a simple tool for plotting data values to a 
device context.


Two structures are provided:
===========================================================
> (struct data-set ((points (listof (is-a?/c point%)))
		    (connected? any?)
		    (pen (is-a?/c pen%))
		    (min-x number?)
		    (max-x number?)   
		    (min-y number?)   
		    (max-y number?)))

points: the list of data values.
connected: determines whether the points are connected by a line or not.
pen: the pen% to draw the points/lines with.
min-x, max-x, min-y, max-y: indicate the window coordinates that the
data should be drawn in.

===========================================================

> (struct plot-setup ((axis-label-font (is-a?/c font%))
		      (axis-number-font (is-a?/c font%))
		      (axis-pen (is-a?/c pen%))
		      (grid? any?)
		      (grid-pen (is-a?/c pen%))
		      (x-axis-marking (listof number?))
		      (y-axis-marking (listof number?))
		      (x-axis-label string?)
		      (y-axis-label string?)))

axis-label-font: the font% the axis-labels is drawn with.
axis-number-font: the font% the numbering on the axes is
drawn with.
axis-pen: the pen% the axis is drawn with.
grid?: whether a grid should be drawn in at each axis marking.
grid-pen: the pen% to draw the grid with.
x-axis-marking: where marks should be placed on the x-axis.
y-axis-marking: where marks should be placed on the y-axis.
x-axis-label-string: the x-axis label.
y-axis-label-string: the y-axis label.

===========================================================

One function is provided:
===========================================================
> (plot (is-a?/c dc<%>) (listof data-set?) plot-setup?)

Draws the data-sets on the dc<%> configured by the setup.
Uses window coordinates that will accommodate all of the
data sets.

                  _include-bitmap.ss_

[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]

The include-bitmap.ss library provides a `include-bitmap form that
takes a filename containing a bitmap and "inlines" the bitmap into the
program. The advantage of "inlining" the bitmap is that a stand-alone
executable can be created that contains the bitmap and does not refer
to the original image file.

> (include-bitmap file-spec)                       SYNTAX

The `file-spec' is the same as for MzLib's `include': a path string, a
`build-path' form, or a `lib' form.

> (include-bitmap/relative-to source file-spec)    SYNTAX

Analogous to `include-at/relative-to', though only a source is needed
(no context).
