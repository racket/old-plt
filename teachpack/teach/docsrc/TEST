Testing in general: 
-------------------

Each file FF-lib.ss comes with the file FF-test.ss, which can test some
part of the FF functionality. Someone needs to add error tests, i.e., 
tests of what happens when the interface functions receive the wrong 
kind of arguments or the wrong number of arguments. 

Testing of PING and PROTECT: 
----------------------------

To test the trace* functions in the pingp-lib file, simulate by 
  setting LIB to pingp-play-lib.ss
  opening pingp-test-trace.ss
  EXECUTE

To test _play_ in the pingp-lib file, play the game by 
  setting LIB to pingp-play-lib.ss
  opening pingp-play-test.ss
  EXECUTE

Or test directly with code in pingp-test.ss; follow instructions at top.
This test is useful if interface to play changes. 

     ----------------------------------------------------------

To test _protect_ in pingp-lib, play the game by 
  setting LIB to protect-play-lib.ss
  opening protect-play-test.ss
  EXECUTE

Or test directly with code in protect-test.ss; follow instructions at top.
This test is useful if interface to protect changes.
