_Version_ or _version_: PLT software online version checking
==========================================================

The version collection allows online version checking of 
PLT software.  The user-side software sends version 
information about installed software to a server that
compares that information against the latest released
versions.

In particular, the user-side software sends to the server

 - the binary version as reported by (version), a 
   MzScheme primitive, and
 - the values of the release-version and release-iteration  
    fields in the info.ss file for collections, if 
    those fields exist

If the binary version is out of date, that information is
reported to the user.  Otherwise, the status of each 
package is reported.  The determination of whether a 
package is up-to-date is made on the server side.

Two files may be used to run version checks from 
MrEd and MzScheme:

> check-text.ss 
(for MrEd or MzScheme)

> check-gui.ss 
(for MrEd)

These files contain modules that export a procedure 
named check-version:

 (require (lib "check-gui.ss" "version"))

and

 (require (lib "check-text.ss" "version"))

For check-text.ss, the procedure is called with 

> (check-version) 

For check-gui.ss, the procedure is called with 

> (check-version [frame]) 

where the optional argument `frame' is either 
a frame% instance or #f, the default.
