\section{Introduction}

%With the availability of a Python-to-Scheme compiler, Python programmers can benefit from using the DrScheme suite to develop their code, as they will automatically inherit all the development tools provided with the IDE.  Scheme programmers are likely to benefit as well, considering they will be able to access the rich Python run-time system from their Scheme programs.

Programming languages are tools wielded by software developers.  This paper describes a compiler that translates one such language, Python, into another, MzScheme.  The translator allows Python developers to use PLT's software development tools and provides Scheme developers access to the rich Python runtime system.

  Section~\ref{background} will present the necessary background for the project, followed in section~\ref{grammar} by the BNF grammar used by the compiler.  Finally, the fourth section will describe the current implementation of the compiler.
