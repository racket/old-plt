- figure out the "right" way to compute the build directory for use in make script
- move type-checking to C, so that the bindings pass through directly and get the right inferred names.
- get external syntax as specified by SRFI 8.
- why doesn't scheme_raise_exn work?
- test suite
- accurate description of 'keyex'?
- collection dependences: doesn't recompile after change to substitutions
- numbers not properly coerced to integers for integer-type vectors. (you just get 0)
- vector-set! fails silently when coercions fail (e.g., (s32vector-set! v 0 32.423))
- collection dependencies: doesn't recompile after change to scheme version
