ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

The url package helps programmers use URLs as specified in RFC 1738:
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt

TYPES ----------------------------------------------------------------

> url
  struct url (scheme host port path params query fragment)
  scheme : string or #f
  host : string or #f
  port : number or #f
  path : string
  params : string or #f
  query : string or #f
  fragment : string or #f

  The basic structure for all URLs.

  http://www.cs.rice.edu:80/cgi-bin/finger;xyz?name=shriram&host=nw#top
    1          2          3       4         5           6            7

  1 = scheme, 2 = host, 3 = port, 4 = path,
  5 = params, 6 = query, 7 = fragment

  If the scheme is "file", then the path is a platform-dependent
  string assumed to have been constructed using build-path.  Otherwise
  it's a url-path as defined in the standard.

> pure-port

  A pure port is one from which the MIME headers have been removed, so
  that what remains is purely the first content fragment.

> impure-port

  An impure port is one that still has its MIME headers.  Contrast
  with a pure-port.

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

> unixpath->path

  This procedure, which used to be provided by this library, is no
  longer supported.

> (string->url string) -> url

  Turns a string into a URL.  If the string represents a URL with
  scheme "file", the portion of the string past "file:" must respond
  to either absolute-path? or relative-path?.  It is then inserted
  verbatim into the url structure.

> (combine-url/relative url string) -> url

  Given a base URL and a relative path, combines the two and returns a
  new URL as per the URL combination specification.  Call the
  arguments base and relative.  They are combined according to the
  following rules (applied in order until one matches):
  - If either argument is an empty URL, the result is the other
    argument.
  - If relative sports a scheme, then the result is relative.
  - If the base has scheme "file", the procedure uses the special rule 
    specified below.
  - If relative specifies a host, then the result is relative.
  Failing the above, relative inherit's base's host and port.  Then:
  - If the path of relative begins with a "/", the result is relative.
  - If the path of relative is empty, then relative inherits base's
    params and query, and the result is relative.
  - Otherwise base and relative are combined as per the standard
    specification of merging and normalization.

  On combining "file" schemes:

  If the base has scheme "file", relative is treated as a
  slash-separated path (unless it contains an empty path --- only
  params, queries, and fragments --- in which case the path is not
  used).  These path fragments are combined using build-path, starting
  with the base's path.  Three path segments are special: ".."
  corresponds to an 'up directive to build-path, while "." and ""
  correspond to 'same.  As a consequence, if relative begins with "/",
  this does not make it an absolute URL: the leading slash is treated
  as if the initial segment is "", so this has no effect, and base's
  path remains the base path of the result.  If base refers to a
  directory, relative is indexed from that directory; if base refers
  to a file, relative is indexed from the directory containing the
  file.  Note that if base does not refer to an actual directory that
  exists on the filesystem, then it must syntactically be a directory
  as understood by split-path.

  The above algorithm tests for the presence of a directory to
  correctly combine paths.  As a result, it can raise any exception
  raised by directory-exists?.  None of these exceptions is trapped by
  the procedure; consumers must be prepared for them.

> (netscape/string->url string) -> url

  Turns a string into a URL, applying (what appear to be) Netscape's
  conventions on automatically specifying the scheme: a string
  starting with a slash gets the scheme "file", while all others get
  the scheme "http".

> (url->string url) -> string

  Generates a string corresponding to the contents of the url struct.
  In the case of a URL with the "file:" scheme, the result does not
  include the params, query, or fragment portion of the URL.

> (get-pure-port url [list-of-strings]) -> input-port

  Takes a URL and returns a pure port corresponding to it.  Writes the
  optional strings to the server.  For the "file" scheme, uses
  open-input-file, does not handle exceptions, and ignores the
  optional strings.

> (get-impure-port url [list-of-strings]) -> input-port

  Takes a URL and returns an impure port corresponding to it.  Writes
  the optional strings to the server.  There are no impure ports with
  scheme "file".

> (display-pure-port input-port) -> void

  Writes the output of a pure port.  For debugging purposes.

> (purify-port input-port) -> string

  Purifies a port, returning the MIME headers. The "head.ss" library
  provides procedures, such as `extract-field, for manipulating the
  header.

> (call/input-url url url->port-proc port->void-proc [list-of-strings]) -> void

  First argument is the URL to open.  Second is a procedure that takes
  a URL and turns it into a (pure or impure) port.  The third takes
  the (pure or impure) port and handles its contents.  The optional
  fourth argument is a set of strings to send to the server.

PRAGMATICS -----------------------------------------------------------

_file:_

  The path portion of a file: URL is a platform-dependent string as
  constructed by build-path.  Therefore, the simplest way to construct
  a file: URL is to string-append "file:" onto the output of
  build-path (or build-relative-path), then pass this to string->url
  to obtain a URL structure.  Refer to the documentation on pathname
  utilities to specify disks and so forth.

_web documents_

  To access the text of a document from the Web, first obtain its URL
  as a string; convert this into a url structure using string->url;
  then open the document using get-pure-port or get-impure-port,
  depending on whether or not you wish to examine its MIME headers.
  At this point you have a regular input port with which to process
  the document like any other file.  Note that currently the only
  supported protocol is "http".  The "news" protocol is not supported
  directly by this library, but the news library in this collection
  can be used to read NNTP documents.

EXAMPLE --------------------------------------------------------------

 (require (lib "url.ss" "net"))
 (define url:cs (string->url "http://www.cs.rice.edu/"))
 (define (test url)
   (call/input-url url get-pure-port display-pure-port))
 (test url:cs)

UNITS ----------------------------------------------------------------

The _url-sig.ss_ module exports the _net:url^_ signature which contains
the names documented above. the _url-unit.ss_ module exports _url@_,
a unit that imports nothing and exports the names in net:url^.
 
==========================================================================
_URL viewing_
==========================================================================

To load directly: (require (lib "sendurl.ss" "net"))

The _sendurl.ss_ module defines one procedure:

> (send-url str) - opens the url in a platform-specific manner,
  sending a message to the local browser to display the url named
  by `str'.

==========================================================================
_CGI_ backends, _WWW_
==========================================================================

To load directly: (require (lib "cgi.ss" "net"))
Module files: _cgi.ss_ - provides the procedures documented below
              _cgi-unit.ss_ - provides unit net:cgi@
              _cgi-sig.ss_ - provides signalture net:cgi^

ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

The cgi package helps programmers write scripts that follow the Common
Gateway Interface (CGI/1.1) protocol of the World-Wide Web:
http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/

INTERACTIONS ---------------------------------------------------------

The CGI library expects to be run in a certain context as defined by
the CGI standard.  This means, for instance, that certain environment
variables will be bound.  Unfortunately, not all CGI environments
provide this.  For instance, the FastCGI library, despite its name,
does not bind the environment variables required of the standard.
Users of FastCGI will need to bind REQUEST_METHOD and possibly also
QUERY_STRING to successfully employ the CGI library.  The FastCGI
library ought to provide a way to extract the values bound to these
variables; the user can then put these into the CGI program's
environment using PLT Scheme's `putenv' function.

TYPES ----------------------------------------------------------------

binding:

  A binding is an association of a form item with its value.  Some form
  items (such as checkboxes) may correspond to multiple bindings.  A
  binding is a tag-string pair, where a tag is a symbol or a string.

bindings:

  A list of `binding's.

html-string:

  A text string that has been escaped according to HTML conventions.

EXCEPTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------

> cgi-error
  struct cgi-error ()

  cgi-error is a super-structure for all exceptions thrown by this
  library.

> incomplete-%-suffix
  struct (incomplete-%-suffix cgi-error) (chars)
  chars : list of chars
  
  Used when a % in a query is followed by an incomplete suffix.  The
  characters of the suffix -- excluding the "%" -- are provided by the
  exception.

> invalid-%-suffix
  struct (invalid-%-suffix cgi-error) (char)
  char : char

  Used when the character immediately following a % in a query is
  invalid.

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

> (get-bindings) -> bindings
> (get-bindings/post) -> bindings
> (get-bindings/get) -> bindings

  Returns the bindings that corresponding to the options specified by
  the user.  The /post and /get forms work only when POST and GET
  forms are used, respectively, while get-bindings determines the kind
  of form that was used and invokes the appropriate function.

> (extract-bindings symbol-or-string bindings) -> list of strings

  Given a key and a set of bindings, extract-bindings determines which
  ones correspond to a given key.  There may be zero, one, or many
  associations for a given key.

> (extract-binding/single symbol-or-string bindings) -> string
  
  Given a key and a set of bindings, extract-binding/single ensures
  that the key has exactly one association, and returns it.

> (output-http-headers) -> void

  Outputs all the http headers needed for a normal html response.
  Only call this function if you are not using generate-html-output
  or generate-error-output.

> (generate-html-output html-string list-of-html-strings [color color color color color]) -> void

  The first argument is the title.  The second is a list of strings
  that consist of the body.  The last five arguments are each strings
  representing a HTML color; in order, they represent the color of the
  text, the background, un-visited links, visited links, and a link
  being selected.

> (string->html string) -> html-string

  Converts a string into an html-string by applying the appropriate
  HTML quoting conventions.

> (generate-link-text string html-string) -> html-string

  Takes a string representing a URL, a html-string for the anchor
  text, and generates HTML corresponding to an achor.

> (generate-error-output list-of-html-strings) -> <exit>

  The procedure takes a series of strings representing the body,
  prints them with the subject line "Internal error", and forces the
  script to exit.

> (get-cgi-method) -> string

  Returns either "GET" or "POST".  Always returns a string when
  invoked inside a CGI script.  Unpredictable otherwise.

> (bindings-as-html bindings) -> list of html-strings

  Converts a set of bindings into a list of html-string's.  Useful for
  debugging.

_sending mail_, _sendmail_
==========================================================================

To load directly: (require (lib "sendmail.ss" "net"))
Module files: _sendmail.ss_ - provides the procedures documented below
              _sendmail-unit.ss_ - provides unit net:sendmail@
              _sendmail-sig.ss_ - provides signalture net:sendmail^


ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

The sendmail package helps programmers write programs that need to
send electronic mail messages.  The package assumes the existence of a
conformant sendmail program on the local system; see also the SMTP
package, below (and, in most cases, use it instead).

TYPES ----------------------------------------------------------------

  All strings used in mail messages are assumed to conform to their
  corresponding SMTP specifications, except as noted otherwise.

EXCEPTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------

> no-mail-recipients
  struct (no-mail-recipients exn) ()

  Raised when no mail recipients were specified.

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

> (send-mail-message/port from-string subject-string to-list-of-strings cc-list-of-strings bcc-list-of-string) -> output-port

  The first argument is the header for the sender, the second is the
  subject line, the third a list of To: recipients, the fourth a list
  of CC: recipients, and the fifth a list of BCC: recipients.  The
  optional sixth argument is used for other mail headers, which must
  be specified completely formatted.

  The return value is an output port into which the client must write
  the message.  Clients are urged to use close-output-port on the
  return value as soon as the necessary text has been written, so that
  the sendmail process can complete.

  The sender can hold any value, though of course spoofing should be
  used with care.

> (send-mail-message from-string subject-string to-list-of-strings cc-list-of-strings bcc-list-of-string body-list-of-strings [extra-headers-list-of-strings]) -> void

  The arguments are the same as that for send-mail-message/port except
  that there is one extra input, the list of strings corresponding to
  the mail message (followed by the optional additional headers, if
  present).  There is no interesting return value.

  Lines that contain a single period do not need to be quoted.

==========================================================================
_sending mail_, _SMTP_
==========================================================================

To load directly: (require (lib "smtp.ss" "net"))
Module files: _smtp.ss_ - provides the procedures documented below
              _smtp-unit.ss_ - provides unit net:smtp@
              _smtp-sig.ss_ - provides signalture net:smtp^

ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

The SMTP package helps programmers write programs that need to send
electronic mail messages using SMTP. The client must provide the
address of an SMTP server; in contrast, the mail package (see above)
uses a pre-configured sendmail on the local system.

TYPES ----------------------------------------------------------------

  The head package defines the format of a `header' string, which is
  used by `send-smtp-message'. The head package also provides
  utilities to verify the formatting of a mail address. The procedures
  of the SMTP package assume that the given string arguments are
  well-formed.

EXCEPTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------

  Communication errors are signalled via exn:user structure instances.

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

> (smtp-send-message server-string from-string to-list-of-strings header message-list-of-strings [port]) -> void

  The first argument is the IP address of the SMTP server. The
  `from-string' argument specifies the mail address of the sender, and
  `to-listof-strings' is a list of recipient addresses (including
  "To", "CC", and "BCC" recipients). The `header' argument is the
  complete message header, which should already include "From", "To",
  and "CC" fields consistent with the given sender and recipients.
  the `message-list-of-strings' argument is the body of the message,
  where each string in the list corresponds to a single line of
  message text; no string in `message-list-of-strings' should contain
  a carriage return or newline characters. The optional `port'
  argument specifies the IP port to use in contacting the SMTP server;
  the default is 25.

  See the head package for utilities that construct a message headers
  and validate mail address strings.

> (smtp-sending-end-of-message [proc])

  Parameter that detemines a send-done procedure to be called after
  `smtp-send-message' has completely sent the message. Before the
  send-done procedure is called, breaking the thread that is executing
  `smtp-send-message' cancels the send. After the send-done procedure
  is called, breaking may or may not cancel the send (and probably
  won't).

Module files: _imap.ss_ - provides the procedures documented below
              _imap-unit.ss_ - provides unit net:imap@
              _imap-sig.ss_ - provides signalture net:imap^

ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

Implements portions of client-side RFC 2060, Internet Message Access
Protocol - Version 4rev1, Crispin
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2060.txt

TYPES ----------------------------------------------------------------

> imap

  An opaque record reprsenting an IMAP connection.

> imap-flag

  A symbol, but generally not a convenient one to use within a Scheme
  program. The `imap-flag->symbol' and `symbol->imap-flag' procedures
  convert IMAP flags to convenient symbols and vice-versa.

EXCEPTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------

  Communication errors are signalled via exn:user structure instances.

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

> (imap-connect server-string username-string password-string mailbox-string) 
   -> three values: imap, message count, recent message count

  Establishes an IMAP connection to the given server using the given
  username and password, and selects the specified mailbox. The second
  and third return values indicate the total number of message in the
  mailbox and the number of recent messages (i.e., messages received
  since the mailbox was last selected), respectively.

  See also `imap-port-number', below.

  A user's primary mailbox is always called "INBOX".

> (imap-disconnect imap) -> void

  Closes an IMAP connection. The close may fail due to a communication
  error.

> (imap-force-disconnect imap) -> void

  Closes an IMAP connection forcefully (i.e., without send a close
  message to the server). A forced disconnect never fails.

> (imap-reselect imap mailbox-string)
  -> two values: message count and recent message count

  De-selects the mailbox currently selected by the connection and
  selects the specified mailbox, returning the total and recent
  message counts for the new mailbox.

  This procedure is useful for polling a mailbox to see whether there
  are any new messages (by providing the currently selected mailbox as
  the new mailbox), but use imap-status with the 'uidnext flag to
  determine whether a mailbox has changed at all (e.g., via a copy
  instead of a move).

> (imap-status imap mailbox-string status-symbol-list)
  -> list of status values

  Requests information about a mailbox from the server. The
  status-symbol-list specifies the request, and the return value
  includes one value for each symbol in status-symbol-list. The
  allowed status symbols are:
    'messages - number of messages
    'recent - number of recent messages
    'unseen - number of unseen messages
    'uidnext - uid for next received message
    'uidvalidity - id that changes when all uids are changed

> (imap-get-messages imap msg-num-list field-list)
  -> list of field-value lists

  Downloads information for a set of messages. The `msg-num-list'
  argument specifies a set of messages by their message positions (not
  their uids). The `field-list' argument specifies the type of
  information to download for each message. The avilable fields are:

    * 'uid - value is an integer
    * 'header - value is a header (string; see the head package)
    * 'body - value is a string (with CRLF-separated lines)
    * 'flags - value is a list of imap flags
    
  The return value is a list of entry items in parallel to
  `msg-num-list'. Each entry is itself a list containing value items
  in parallel to `field-list'.

  Example:
    (imap-get-message imap '(1 3 5) '(uid header))
    ; => ((107 "From: larry@stooges.com ...")
          (110 "From: moe@stooges.com ...")
          (112 "From: curly@stooges.com ..."))

> (imap-flag->symbol imap-flag) -> symbol
> (symbol->imap-flag symbol) -> imap-flag

  An imap flag is a symbol, but it is generally not a convenient one
  to use within a Scheme program, because it usually starts with a
  backslash and flag comparisions are case-insensitive. The
  `imap-flag->symbol' and `symbol->imap-flag' procedures convert IMAP
  flags to convenient symbols and vice-versa:

      symbol       imap flag
      ------       ----------
     'seen         '|\Seen|            \
     'answered     '|\Answered|        |
     'flagged      '|\Flagged|          > message flags
     'deleted      '|\Deleted|         |
     'draft        '|\Draft|           |
     'recent       '|\Recent|          /

     'noinferiors  '|\Noinferiors|     \
     'noselect     '|\Noselect|         > mailbox flags
     'marked       '|\Marked|          |
     'unmarked     '|\Unmarked|        /

  `imap-flag->symbol' and `symbol->imap-flag' act like the identity
  function when any other symbol/flag is provided.

> (imap-store imap mode msg-num-list imap-flags) -> void

  Sets flags for a set of messages. The mode argument specifies how
  flags are set:

       * '+ - add the given flags to each message
       * '- - remove the given flags from each emssage
       * '! - set each message's flags to the given set

  The `msg-num-list' argument specifies a set of messages by their
  message positions (not their uids). The `flags' argument specifies
  the imap flags to add/remove/install.

  Example:
    (imap-store imap '+ '(1 2 3) (list (symbol->imap-flag 'deleted)))
    ; marks the first three messages to be deleted
    (imap-expunge imap)
    ; permanently removes the first three messages (and possibly others)
    ;  from the currently-selected mailbox

> (imap-expunge imap) -> void

  Purges every message currently marked with the '|\Deleted| flag from
  the mailbox.

> (imap-copy imap msg-num-list dest-mailbox-string) -> void

  Copies the specified messages from the currently selected mailbox to
  the specified mailbox.

> (imap-mailbox-exists? imap mailbox-string) -> bool

  Returns #t if the specified mailbox exists, #f otherwise.

> (imap-create-mailbox imap mailbox-string) -> void

  Creates the specified mailbox. (It must not exist already.)

> (imap-list-child-mailboxes imap mailbox-string [delimiter-string])
  -> list of mailbox-info lists

  Returns information about sub-mailboxes of the given mailbox.  If
  mailbox-string is #f, information about all top-level mailboxes is
  returned. The optional `delimiter-string' is determined
  automatically (via `imap-get-hierarchy-delimiter') if it is not
  provided.

  The return value is a list of mailbox-information lists. Each
  mailbox-information list contains two items:
    * a list of imap flags for the mailbox
    * the mailbox's name

> (imap-get-hierarchy-delimiter imap) -> string

  Returns the server-specific string that is used as a separator in
  mailbox path names.

> (imap-port-number [k])

  A parameter that determines the server port number. The initial
  value is 143.

ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

Implements utlities for RFC 822 headers and mail addresses.

TYPES ----------------------------------------------------------------

> header

  A string that is an RFC-882-compliant header. A header string
  contains a series of CRLF-delimitted fields, and ends with two CRLFs
  (the first one terminates the last field, and the second terminates
  the header).

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

> empty-header

  A string correcponding to the empty header, useful for building up
  headers with `insert-field' and `append-headers'.

> (validate-header candidate-header-string) -> void

  If the format of `candidate-header-string' matches RFC 822, void is
  returned, otherwise an exception is raised.

> (extract-field field-string header) -> string or #f

  Returns the header content for the specified field, or #f if the
  field is not in the header. `field-string' should not end with ":",
  and it is used case-insensitively. The returned string will not
  contain the field name, color separator, of CRLF terminator for the
  field; however, if the field spans multiple lines, the CRLFs
  separating the lines will be intact.

  Example:
    (extract-field "TO" (insert-field "to" "me@localhost" empty-header))
    ; => "me@localhost"

> (remove-field field-string header) -> header

  Creates a new header by removing the specified field from `header'
  (or the first instance of the field, if it occurs multiple
  times). If the field is not in `header', then the return value is
  `header'.

> (insert-field field-string value-string header) -> header

  Creates a new header by prefixing the given header with the given
  field-value pair. `value-string' should not contain a terminating
  CRLF, but a multi-line value (perhaps created with
  `data-lines->data') may contain seperator CRLFs.

> (append-headers a-header another-header) -> header

> (standard-message-header from-string to-list-of-strings cc-list-of-strings bcc-list-of-strings subject-string) -> header

  Creates a standard mail header given the sender, various lists of
  recipients, and a subject. (The BCC recipients do not acually appear
  in the header, but they're accepted anyway to complete the
  abstarction.)

> (data-lines->data list-of-strings) -> string

  Merges multiple lines for a single field value into one string,
  adding CRLF-TAB separators.

> (extract-addresses string kind) -> list of strings or
                                     list of list of strings

  Parses `string' as a list of comma-delimited mail addresses, raising
  an exception if the list is ill-formed. This procedure can be used
  for single-address strings, in which case the returned list should
  contain only one address.

  The `kind' argument specifies which portion of an address should be
  returned:

     * 'name - the free-form name in the address, or the address
               itself if no name is available:
        "John Doe <doe@localhost>" => "Jon Doe"
        "doe@localhost (Johnny Doe)" => "Johnny Doe"
        "doe@localhost" => "doe@localhost"

     * 'address - just the mailing address, without any free-form
               names:
        "Jon Doe <doe@localhost>" => "doe@localhost"
        "doe@localhost (Johnny Doe)" => "doe@localhost"
        "doe@localhost" => "doe@localhost"

     * 'full - the full address, essentially as it appears in the
               input, but normalized:
        "Jon Doe   < doe@localhost >" => "Jon Doe <doe@localhost>"
        "  doe@localhost  (Johnny Doe)" => "doe@localhost (Johnny Doe)"
        "doe@localhost" => "doe@localhost"

     * 'all - a list containing each of the three posibilities:
              free-form name, address, and full address (in that
              order)

  Example:
    (extract-addresses " \"Doe, John\" <doe@localhost>, john" 'address)
    ; => ("doe@localhost" "john")
           
> (assemble-address-field list-of-address-strings) -> string

  Creates a header field value from a list of addresses. The addresses
  are comma-separated, and possibly broken into multiple lines.

ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

Implements part of a DNS client, based on RFC 1035. The name cache
does not properly time out entries, however.

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

> (dns-get-address nameserver-string address-string) -> address-string

  Consults the specified nameserver (normally a numerical address like
  "128.42.1.30") to obtain a numerical address for the given internet
  address.

  The query record sent to the DNS server includes the "recursive"
  bit, but `dns-get-address' also implements a recursive search itself
  in case the server does not provide this optional feature.

> (dns-get-mail-exchanger nameserver-string address-string) -> address-string

  Consults the specified nameserver to obtain the address for a mail
  exchanger the given mail host address. For example, the mail
  exchanger for "ollie.cs.rice.edu" is currently "cs.rice.edu".

> (dns-find-nameserver) -> address-string or #f

  Attempts to find the address of a nameserver on the present system.
  Under Unix, this procedure parses /etc/resolv.conf to extract the
  first nameserver address.

ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

Implements Base 64 (mime-standard) encoder and decoder.

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

> (base64-encode string) -> string

  Consumes a string and returns its Base 64 encoding as a new string.
  The returned string is broken into 72-character lines separated by
  CRLF combinations, and always ends with a CRLF combination unless
  the input is empty.

> (base64-decode string) -> string

  Consumes a string and returns its Base 64 decoding as a new string.

> (base64-encode-stream input-port output-port [newline-string]) -> void

  Reads characters from `input-port' and writes the encoded result to
  `output-port', breaking the output into 72-character lines separated
  by `newline-string', and ending with `newline-string' unless the
  input stream is empty. The default `newline-string' contains just a
  newline (not CRLF). The procedure returns when it encounters an
  end-of-file from `input-port'.

> (base64-decode-stream input-port output-port) -> void

  Reads a Base 64 encoding from `input-port' and writes the decoded
  result to `output-port'. The procedure returns when it encounters an
  end-of-file or Base 64 terminator (=) from `input-port'.
