wxWINDOWS CHANGE LIST
---------------------

Version 1.65 December 1995
--------------------------

- Added wxChart library (directory utils/wxchart).
- Added Dialog Editor (directory utils/dialoged).
- Added wxProperty classes (directory utils/wxprop).
- Added Pressup game sample (directory samples/pressup).
- Some fixes and additions to Tex2RTF (see Tex2RTF manual).
- *NOTE* changed wxScrollBar prototype: 'direction' is now passed
  through the window style parameter.
- Added some wxText/wxMultiText functionality under Windows and Motif.
- Added Matthew's font scheme (mandatory under X, optional under
  Windows).
- Added Matthew's changes to support multiple displays under X.
- Added font facename support under Windows.
- Added dynamic menu deletion code from Matthew: Motif, XView, Windows.
- Added wxItem::SetLabelFont, GetLabelFont for Windows.
- Added more Set/Get functions for wxGauge, wxSlider.
- Arguments to SetItem/Label/BackgroundColour now reference
  to wxColour instead of pointer. A copy of the wxColour is
  now stored, reducing memory management problems.
- Fixed another memory bug in constraint system (added otherWin = NULL to
  ResetIfWin in wx_lay.cc).
- Fixed wxRadioBox::SetLabel/ButtonFont (Windows).
- Fixed wxWindow::Refresh under X to clear background if requested.
- Added contributed timeout code for IPC classes.
- Untested wxFrame/wxDialogBox::OnChar/OnCharHook implementation for XView and
  Motif.
- Added wxDecToHex, wxHexToDec utility functions: used in resource system
  and Dialog Editor.

Version 1.64 October 1995
-------------------------

- Added wxRecordSet::GetPrimaryKeys.
- Added Set/GetExitOnFrameDelete (Windows).
- Added wxPoem to samples directory.

Version 1.63 August 3rd 1995
----------------------------

- Changed wxRadioBox to take wxHORIZONTAL or wxVERTICAL style parameter:
  doesn't make sense to use the label positioning to determine layout
  style. ***This may break existing code*** so you may need to insert
  wxHORIZONTAL or wxVERTICAL into your radiobox style parameter.
- Added classes: wxDate, wxTime, wxFraction, wxColourDialog,
  wxFontDialog. wxTime, wxFraction remain undocumented.
- Added wxGetLocalTime, wxGetCurrentTime to help wxTime class.
- Cured a constraint system bug that left a dangling pointer: sometimes caused a
  crash on exiting print preview, for example. But there's *still* a bug
  left :-( as identified by Purify.
- Added Matthew Flatt's generic clipboard code to MS Windows platform
  (written in terms of existing clipboard functions).

Version 1.62 (e) June 28 1995
------------------------------

- Fixed layout demo crash (wxRowColSizer::Create called itself).
- Fixed layout algorithm to accept width/height.AsIs() and
  also added wxDebugMsg warnings on constraint failure.

Version 1.62 (d) June 4th 1995
------------------------------

- wxTextWindow now inherits from streambuf, except under
  BC++ (see comments in wb_text.h/cc).
- Added samples/samples.txt, utils/utils.txt, contrib/contrib.txt.
- Added contributed src/x/wx_ipc.cc fix.

Version 1.62 (c) May 28th 1995
-----------------------------

- Added wxFileHistory class, small changes to doc/view API.
- Promoted wxToolBar and wxButtonBar to the main wxWindows
  library and documentation, so I'm afraid you'll need to
  remove a few things from your application makefiles
  if you use these classes.
- Added Matthew's experimental garbage collection patch.

Version 1.62 (b) May 25th 1995 (not publicly released)
-----------------------------

- Added document/view/command architecture and sample.
- Print/preview architecture starting to work(?) under
  UNIX using wxPostScriptDC, with simulated print and
  print setup dialogs. wxPrintSetupData added to tidy
  up the previously global print data.
- Started wxSizer classes; unfinished and undocumented.

Version 1.62 (a) May 8th 1995
-----------------------------

- Added wxScreenDC (undocumented)
- Added Matthew Flatt's X wxClipboard class; not yet
  documented or unified with the Windows functions.
- Added wxApp/wxWindow::OnCharHook hook function (Windows
  only). This means you can provide F1 and ESC functionality:
  wxMessageBox and a few others now respond to ESC.

Version 1.61 (e) May 1995
-------------------------

- Added wx_print.h, wx_print.cc to Windows code:
  a printing and previewing framework.
- Added printing sample (Windows only).
- Added wxUpdateIterator code, to be called within
  OnPaint to optimize repainting.
