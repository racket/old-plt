_Games_
=======

The "Games" (Unix: plt/bin/games) executable is created by "Setup PLT"
(Unix: plt/bin/setup-plt). You can also start Games via Help Desk
(search for "games").

The Games program lets you select one of the following games:

 * _Same_ - The object is to score points by removing dots from the
   board. Click the "Help" button in Same for more details.

 * _Go Fish_ (against two computer players) - The children's card game
   where you try to get rid of all you cards by forming pairs. The
   status line at the bottom of the window provides instructions as
   you go. [The computer players are not smart.]

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Blackjack_ - Standard rules, plus the following specifics:

      - 1 player (not counting the dealer)
      - 4 decks, reshuffled after 3/4 of the cards are used
      - Dealer stands on soft 17s
      - Splitting is allowed only on the first two cards, and only if
        they are equal; 10 and the face cards are all considered equal
        for splitting
      - Doubling is allowed on all unsplit hands, not on split hands
      - No blackjacks after splitting
      - No surrender

 * _Gin Rummy_ (against the computer) - Put all cards in your hand
   into straight and 3- or 4-of-a-kind sets to win. On each turn, you

   must discard one of your own cards. [The computer players is
   smart.]
