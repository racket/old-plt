This paper describes a Python-to-Scheme compiler.  The compiler translates Python code into its Scheme equivalent and provides a runtime system to model the Python environment.  The generated Scheme code may be evaluated or used by DrScheme tools, giving Python programmers access to the entire DrScheme suite while writing in their favorite language, and giving Scheme programmers access to Python libraries.
