The context of this file doesn't matter.
It's existence causes the launcher-maker to
create a "self-replacable launcher", which
means that the executable starts MzScheme/MrEd
in such a way that the launcher executable
is not in use while the launched code runs
(e.g., the laucher peforms a process-replacing
execv()).
