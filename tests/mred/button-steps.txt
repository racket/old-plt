Click the "Hit Me" button. "Callback Ok" should appear in the console.

Click "Check". "All Ok" should appear in the console.

Repeat the above two steps.

Click "Disable Test" and quickly click "Hit Me". The button should
 become disabled for a second, then become re-enabled, but the
 click on "Hit Me" should not invoke the callback.

Repeat the first two steps above.

Click "Set Default". If this is a "Button Frame", nothing should
 happen. If this is a "Button Dialog Box", the "Hit Me" button *may*
 become highlighted so that typing Return is the same as hitting the
 button; whether this actually happens is platform-specific.
