INSTALLATION:
============

Please read the documentation files first:
	- README		general information
	- README.MARKUS		real general information
	- TODO, CHANGES-TODO	not implemented yet
	- README.XFIG		copyright issue XFig
	- COPYING.AIAI		copyright for AIAI code
	- COPYING.GNU		copyright for my code (GNU)

To obtain the wxWindows-Xt library, first uncompress and untar the compressed
tar file in an appropriate directory.

Modify wxxt/src/make.env to fit to your system. If you want to use the
Imakefile, also modify following files (some information is the same
as in make.env):

	wxxt/wx-xt.tmpl
	wxxt/wx-xt.rules

	HaveWBuild specifies, that you want to use the wbuild utility
	(wxxt/contrib/wbuild). You will need it, if you want to modify
	the X widgets, but not to build the library (C-files are included
	in this package).

To include/exclude some packages modify:

	wxxt/src/wxSetup.h

Then you can compile the library via "make" (or "imake"). For MrEd,
it's best to run "make wx" from the MrEd directory. Otherwise:

	CD to the src subdirectory.

	Then execute the following command:

		xmkmf ("imake" only)

	Then simply execute: 

		make

	which will build the library.
	Then do:

	     	make install (not needed for MrEd)

	which will install the library and the includefiles. (The includefiles
	will be linked and not copied. If you prefer a copy, replace $(LN) by
	$(CP) in the install-section of the Imakefile.)
	This is NOT necessary to build the samples, demos, and wxHelp!
	For these you need the source tree only.
