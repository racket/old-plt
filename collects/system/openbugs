- mred:console%'s initialization argument: `close-item?' is being ignored

- mred:edit% and mred:media-canvas% do not interact well. 
  It is okay to use a mred:wrapping-canvas%, however.

This demonstrates the bug:

(let ([e (make-object mred:edit%)])
    (send (make-object mred:media-canvas% 
           (make-object mred:horizontal-panel% 
             (make-object mred:frame% '() "")))
	  set-media
	  e)
    (send e insert "hi"))

It only shows up when you insert into the buffer.

- backup files don't preserve permissions

- the directory line in the common-file-dialogs is confusing

- embedded snips should be reset on the styles-fixed? ivar

- "scale" in open-viewport does effect the size
  of the viewport, but is ignored by at least
  draw-line into that viewport.
	
- you cannot break (read)

- pathnames are normalized to early and can cause automouter problems

- control-l doesn't get the horizontal direction right.
