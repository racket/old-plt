 Compiling for MacOS X
========================================================================

Currently, we're using Apple's Project Builder to compile MrEd for OS X.
Project Builder is available on Apple's Developer Tools CD for OS X.  It
is free, if you say the right words in the right places.

These instructions also assume a familiarity with the Terminal, and the
ability to run basic UNIX commands in a shell. 

1) Run the "configure" script in plt/src. For more details
on this, read the UNIX section of the README in plt/src.

2) Open the file plt/src/mac/proj-builder/MrEd/MrEd.pbproj in 
Project Builer.

3) Select Build, from the Build menu

When finished, assuming all goes well, the application will be 
located in plt/src/mac/proj-builder/MrEd/build.  Move it to
wherever you like.  

Before you run it, you'll need to set your PLTHOME environment
variable. If you're only planning to run it from the command
line, this is easy: you'll need to add a few lines to your shell's
startup files. PLTHOME should refer to ... well, wherever the top
level plt directory resides.  So, for instance, I checked out the 
cvs tree in /Users/clements, so my PLTHOME is set to 
/Users/clements/plt.

If you're planning to start the application from the Finder, you'll
have to do a bit more magic

There are two 
ways to run it; from the Finder, or from the command line.
