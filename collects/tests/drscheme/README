This directory contains code for automatic testing
of DrScheme.






PR-based tests:
  
  |# menu-test.ss
     pr-144.ss
     pr-17.ss
     pr-246.ss
     pr-39.ss
     pr-46.ss
     pr-48.ss
     pr-51.ss
     pr-58.ss
     pr-80.ss
     pr-99.ss
     repl-test.ss #|

Ideally, each test should be run with a fresh invocation
of DrScheme.  Since that's time-consuming, you can
run all tests by executing "drscheme-test.ss".

A small amount of manual intervention is needed during
the tests.  By intervention, we mean pushing buttons 
in dialogs that popup during the tests.

The progress and results of the tests are reported to
standard output.  You should examine this output to determine
whether if the tests were successful. 

The code is maintained by Paul Steckler.  The original code
was by Robby Findler.

There are some other files in this directory, which appear
to be unused, such as tmp.ss, and line-art.ss.  The directory
syncheck/ appears to be unused.
