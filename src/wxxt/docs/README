This version of wxWindows has been modified beyond Markus Holzem's
modification of the wxWindows from AIAI. The changes include
the following:


  * Changed (fixed) keyboard focus. I got rid of all XSetInputFocus
    calls and added a callback in the Common widget class to trigger
    wxWindow::SetFocus() and wxWindow::KillFocus().

  * Fixed the classic callback-after-object-deletion bug; when
    a wxWindows object is destroyed, the widget destruction is
    merely cued. Callbacks to the widget before it is actually
    destroyed attept to reference an invalid wxWindow pointer.
    I added an indirection in the clientData pointer.

  * Explcitly called XtReleaseGC in all widgets that use XtGetGC.
    This seems to have been purposefully left out, since it was
    left out everywhere. However, without the explcit release, my
    test program that creates hundreds of widgets gets gradually
    larger and slower (and it seems to be XtGetGC that takes more and
    more time).

  * Fixed the menu tracking and then made menus work like
    Windows/Motif menus.

  * Fixed drawing of canvas border and scroll bars on B&W screen.

  * Implemented fully dynamic menus as in Motif, Windows, and Mac
    wxWindows.

  * Normalized graphics (very little work).
  
  * Fixed the use of XtAppNextEvent in wxApp::Dispatch().

  * Added fonts-by-name as in Motif, Windows, and Mac wxWindows.

  * Integrated wxImage.

  * Added SafeSock stuff to IPC classes.

  * Changed a bunch of things for garbage collection.
