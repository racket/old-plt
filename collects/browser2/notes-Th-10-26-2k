Notes:

browser.ss
- integrated gui-framework.ss
- uses new classes, browser-frame% (doesn't trap Enter key) and browser-editor-canvas% (auto resize min-height)
- History consists of two lists: backwards and forwards, each with a corresponding constant defining max length.
  As pages are viewed, these lists accumulate up to MAX_BACK_HIST and MAX_FORW_HIST, respectively, editors containing rendered-html.  History lists are FIFO (first in, first out).
- back button loads previously viewed page in the browser
- forward button loads the next page in the browser's history.
- reload button reopens and rerenders html on the page
*- home button loads the home page in the browser
*- print button prints the page
*- history choice-box provides drop down list for viewing and selecting from the browser's history.
- textfield used to enter URL to open in browser

* Denotes not implemented yet.  All other buttons are somewhat functional.
**Also, the browser initialized with blank editor, which is then rolled into history after user begins to navigate.  This can be fixed when bgcolor-text% is implemented. 

bgcolor.ss
- seems to render background color ok, however, need a way to instantiate with or without a parameter.
