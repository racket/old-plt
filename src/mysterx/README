This is the source code for MysterX.  Compilation requires 
Visual C++ 6.0.

	nmake clean

gets rid of existing binaries, while 

	nmake

compiles all the binaries.

In the Makefile, there are three variables to set:

	o MZC - path to the mzc compiler
	o HTMLHELP - directory for MS Help Workshop
	o SHELL32 - directory containing LIB/SHELL32.LIB
           and related header files

You may need to change these according to your local
installation before compiling.

If you get errors about a missing file atlbase.h,
check the value of the environment variable INCLUDE.
The subdirectory ATL beneath the Visual C++ directory
needs to be in the list of INCLUDE directories.
For example, if Visual Studio 6 is installed at the root of
the C: drive, that directory would be
  C:\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\ATL

The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop must be installed to
build mysterx.dll.  The files are on the Visual Studio
CD in the directory HTMLHELP; they may be downloaded from
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tools/htmlhelp/wkshp/download_main.htm

The code for mx_element_focus in htmlutil.cxx uses the
COM interface IHTMLElement2.  That interface is defined
in MSHTML.H in recent versions of the Platform SDK (more 
recent than the VC++6 release).  If you don't have such a 
Platform SDK, comment out the code in the body of that 
function.
