The _launcherr.ss_ library in the "launcher" collection imports
nothing and exports the following procedures for creating MzScheme and
MrEd launcher executables:

> (make-mred-launcher args dest) - Creates the launcher `dest'. The
   `dest' executeable (for the current OS platform) will start MrEd
   with the command-line arguments specified as strings in the list
   `args'. Extra arguments passed to the launcher at run-time will be
   appended (modulo special X flag handling, as described below) to
   this list and passed on to MrEd.

   `make-mred-launcher' transforms `args' as necessary to avoid
   mutations caused by passing the strings through the
   platform-specific launching mechanism (e.g, as sh arguments), so
   the strings in `flags' arrive to MrEd intact.

   For X Windows, the script created by `make-mred-launcher' detects
   and handles X Windows flags specially when they appear as the
   initial arguments to the script. Instead of appending these
   arguments to the end of `args', they are spliced in after any X
   Windows flags already listed listed in `args'. The remaining
   arguments (i.e., all script flags and arguments after the last X
   Windows flag or argument) are then appended after the spliced
   `args'.

> (make-mzscheme-launcher args dest) - Same as `make-mred-launcher', but
   for starting MzScheme. (No special X windows handling.)


> (make-mred-program-launcher file collection dest) - Calls
   `make-mred-launcher' with arguments that start the MrEd program
   implemednted by `collection': (list "-mvL-" file collection)

> (make-mzscheme-program-launcher file collection dest) - Calls
   `make-mzscheme-launcher' with arguments that start the MzScheme
   program implemented by `file' in `collection': (list "-mvL-" file
   collection)


> (mred-program-launcher-path name) returns a pathname for an executable
   in the current PLT home directory called `name'.  For Windows, the
   ".exe" suffix is automatically appended to `name'. For Unix and
   BeOS, `name' is changed to lowercase, whitespace is changed to `-',
   and the path includes the bin subdirectory of the PLT home
   directory.

> (mzscheme-program-launcher-path name) returns the same pathname as
   (mred-program-launcher-path name).


> (install-mred-program-launcher file collection name) - Calls
   `make-mred-launcher' with the destintation returned by
   (mred-program-launcher-path name); the `file' and `collection'
   arguments are passed on to `make-mred-launcher'.

> (install-mzscheme-program-launcher file collection name) - Calls
   `make-mzscheme-launcher' with the destintation returned by
   (mzscheme-program-launcher-path name); the `file' and `collection'
   arguments are passed on to `make-mzscheme-launcher'.
