HOMEWORK SUBMISSION SERVLET
===========================

The homework submission servlet is a tool for students to electronically submit
homework assignments. It supports username and password authentication,
changing passwords, logging out, account creation, and courses, a separation of
students from non-students, partnerships, assignments, file submission, student
creation, and instructor-level partnership management.  Future goals are task
assignment, and online grading.

RUNNING
=======

To run the homework submission servlet the following tasks need to be done:

 * The database must be set up and running (see DATABASE).
 * The PLT Web server must be configured and running (see WEB SERVER).
 * The use-case tests must pass and the concurrency tests must indicate that
   the servlet will run stable on the system (see TESTS).

DATABASE
--------

The DBMS is PostgreSQL 7 or compatible. It must be configured such that the Web 
server can connect to it remotely (via the file data/pg_hba.conf), and
contrib/pgcrypto must be installed. For example, append to data/pg_hba.conf:

 host    all         csu211      129.10.117.161    255.255.255.255   trust

The username `csu211' must be able to connect to the database `homework' with 
no password.

To create the tables, use the file etc/tables.sql as follows:

 psql -h $DB_HOSTNAME -p $PORT -U csu211 homework < tables.sql

WEB SERVER
----------

Configure the Web server's port in the configuration file. Copy the file 
`submit.ss' to the Web server's servlet root (`servlets/').

TESTS
-----

To test that the servlet will work as expected, run `tests/test-servlet.ss' . 
To test memory usage, run `tests/test-memory.ss'; this will loop over the same 
action repeatedly, so kill it when you either get bored or notice that it uses 
too much memory. `tests/test-concurrency.ss' will test that the servlet can 
handle multiple concurrent users.
