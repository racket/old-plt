Are you forgetful? Do you often miss important dates in your life? Are
your loved ones vengeful? If so, this program is for you!

Countdown keeps track of the minute and second of approaching or past
life events. 

To use, first create a .countdownrc in your homedirectory. All of the
expressions in that file will be evaluated in the context of a unit,
with one import: `remember'. remember is a procedure that takes as
first argument a string naming the event. It's six remaining arguments
qare all numbers, describing the second, minute, hour, day of the
month, month and year of the event. Omit the year, and the event will
repreat annually. Omit the month and the event repeats monthly,
etc. Note that the second, minute, and hour all count from zero, not
1.

Say, you have trouble remembering Matthew's birthday. Just put this
line in your .countdownrc and you will never miss it again:

  (remember "Matthew's Birthday November 1st" 59 59 23 1 11)

If you want to remember an event that has starting and ending dates,
use remember-around:

  (remember-around "Christmas Break 1997" 
                   (list 0 0 12 20 12 1997)
                   (list 0 0 12 4 1 1998))

remember-around's second and third arguments are lists whose entries
are the same as the last arguments to remember.

After creating that file, run Countdown like this:

  mred -x -A countdwn

(note the missing "o" in countdwn... thank you 8.3)
It will open a window on your screen and your troubles will be over!
