Version 51:

General 
-------
- check syntax does not work with an unitialized repl when:
  the source contains define-macro. (won't be fixed in the release)

- eval no longer loops forever in mred vocabulary 

- searching keybindings have changed. There are four distinct actions:
   action1: move keyboard focus to the searching window, opening it if necessary, 
            or if already there search forward
   action2: move keyboard focus to the searching window, opening it if necessary, 
            or if already there search backward.
   action3: search again, in the same direction
   action4: move the focus between the main window, searching window and replacment window
   action5: hide the searching window

The actions are mapped to different keys, based on the platform. 

On unix:
 action1 => control-s, meta-%
 action2 => control-r
 action3 => f3
 action4 => control-i
 action5 => control-g

On the macintosh:
  action1 => command-f
  action2 => command-r
  action3 => command-g
  action4 => command-o
  action5 => command-.

On windows:
 action1 => control-f
 action2 => control-r
 action3 => f3, control-g
 action4 => control-i
 action5 => escape

- turned off the file name printouts on splash screen

  evaluate: 
  (wx:write-resource "mred" "splashMessages" 1 (wx:find-path 'setup-file))
  to turn them back on.

- fixed a bug that caused error messages to be displayed in message
  boxes more often than neccessary. (as opposed to printing in the
  repl)

- parenthesis matching is improved

- The empty list is now called "empty" instead of "null" with the
  constructor style printer.

- The analyze button puts up a dialog saying "please wait, loading",
  now.

- the fonts dialog now shows previews of the selected fonts. You
  still need to restart to see the changes, unfortunately.

DrScheme Tools/Libraries
------------------------

- tools must now import wx names explicitly, as a new first import.

- the parameters interface has changed. Instead getting and setting
  the class, the tool programmer must register a function that
  accepts a class and returns a class. See the manual for more
  details.

- process/zodiac-finish has been renamed to process-finish
