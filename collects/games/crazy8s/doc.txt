** To play _Crazy 8s_, run the "Games" application. **

Try to get rid of all you cards by matching the value or suit of the
top card in the discard pile. In the default mode, click a card to
discard it; you can adjust the options so that you discard by dragging
a card from your hand to the discard pile.

An 8 can be discarded at any time, and in that case, the player who
discarded the 8 gets to pick any suit for it (hence the craziness of
8s). When you discard an 8, a panel of buttons appears to the right of
the discard pile, so you can pick the suit.

A player can choose to draw a card instead of discarding, as long as
cards are left in the draw pile. A player's turn continues after
drawing, so a player can continue drawing to find something to
discard. In the default mode, click the face-down draw pile in the
middle of the table; you can adjust the options to that you draw by
dragging it from the draw pile to your hand.

If no cards are left in the deck, a player may pass instead of
discarding. To pass, click the "Pass" button.

The status line at the bottom of the window provides instructions as
you go.
