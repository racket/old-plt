_Setup PLT_ or _setup-plt_: Collection Setup and Unpacking
==========================================================

The Setup PLT executable (bin/setup-plt for Unix) performs two
services:

 * Compiling and setting up all collections: When Setup PLT is run
   without any arguments, it finds all of the current collections (see
   the MzScheme manual for information on collections) and compiles
   all collections with an info.ss library that indicates how the
   collection is compiled (see the mzc manual).

   The --clean (or -c) flag to Setup PLT causes it to delete all
   existing .zo and extension files, thus ensuring a clean build from
   the source files. The exact set of deleted files can be controlled
   by the info.ss file; see below for more info.

   The -l flag takes one or more collection names and restricts Setup
   PLT's action to those collections.

   In addition to compilation, a collection's info.ss library can
   specify executables to be installed in the "plt" directory
   ("plt/bin" under Unix) or other installation actions.

 * Unpacking _.plt_ files: A .plt file is a platform-independent
   distribution archive for MzScheme- and MrEd-based software.  When
   one or more file names are provided as the command line arguments
   to Setup PLT, the files contained in the .plt archive are unpacked
   (according to specifications embedded in the .plt file) and only
   collections specified by the plt file are compiled and setup.

 Compiling and Setting Up Collections
 ------------------------------------

Setup PLT attempts to compile and set up any collection that:

 * has an info.ss library (see the mzc manual for a description of
   info.ss);
 
 * has the 'name' field in info.ss;

 * is either a top-level collection or a sub-collection of a compilable
   collection.

Collections meeting this criteria are compiled using the
`compile-collection-zos' procedure described in the "compiler"
collection. If the -e or --extension flag is specified, then the
collections are also compiled using the `compile-collection-extension'
procedure from "compiler".

Additional info.ss fields trigger additional setup actions:

>  mzscheme-launcher-names - a list of executable names to be
   installed in "plt" (or "plt/bin") to run MzScheme programs
   implemented by the collection. A parallel list of library names
   must be provided by `mzscheme-launcher-libraries'. For each name, a
   launching executable is set up using the launcher collection's
   `make-mzscheme-launcher'. The arguments are "-mve-" and

      (format "~s" `(require (lib <file> <colls> ...)))

   where lib is the file named by mzscheme-launcher-libraries
   and <colls> ... are the collections (and subcollections)
   of the info.ss file. 

   If compile-subcollections mentions a subcollection with
   this field, the executable is also set up for that subcollection.

   If the executable already exists, no action is taken.

>  mzscheme-launcher-libraries - a list of library names in
   parallel to `mzscheme-launcher-names'.

>  mred-launcher-names - a list of executable names to be
   installed in plt (or plt/bin) to run MrEd programs
   implemented by the collection.  This is treated in
   parallel to `mzscheme-launcher-names'. 

>  mred-launcher-libraries - a list of library names in
   parallel to `mred-launcher-names'.

>  install-collection - a string for a library module relative to the
   collection. The module must provide `installer' as a procedure that
   accepts a directory path argument (the path to the collection) and
   performs collection-specific installation work.  This procedure
   should avoid unnecessary work in the case that it is called
   multiple times for the same installation.

>  clean - a list of pathnames to be deleted when the --clean or -c
   flag is passed to Setup PLT. The pathnames must be relative to the
   collection.  If any path names a directory, each of the files
   in the directory are deleted, but none of the subdirectories of the
   directory are checked. If the path names a file, the file is
   deleted.  The default, if this flag is not specified, is to delete
   all files in the "compiled" subdirectory, and all of the files in
   the platform-specific subdirectory of the compiled directory
   for the current platform.

 Setup PLT as a Unit
 -------------------

The _setup-unit.ss_ library in the setup collection exports a _setup@_
signed unit that imports

  setup-option^ - described below
  compiler^ - from "sig.ss" in the "compiler" collection
  compiler:option^  - from "sig.ss" in the "compiler" collection
  launcher-maker^ - from "launcher-sig.ss" in the "launcher" collection

Invoking this unit starts the setup process. The _option-sig.ss_
library in "setup" defines the
>      setup-option^
signature, which is implemented by the _setup:option@_ unit in
_option-unit.ss_. It imports nothing and exports the following
parameters that control the setup process:

> verbose - #t => prints message from `make' to stderr [default: #f]
> make-verbose - #t => verbose `make' [default: #f]
> compiler-verbose - #t => verbose `compiler' [default: #f]
> clean - #t => delete .zo and .so/.dll files in the specified collections
         [default: #f]
> make-zo - #t => compile .zo files [default #t]
> make-so - #t => compile .so/.dll files [default: #f]
> make-launchers - #t => make collection "info.ss"-specified launchers
                   [default: #t]
> call-install - #t => call collection "info.ss"-specified setup code
                 [default: #t]
> specific-collections - a list of collections to set up; the empty
           list means set-up all collections if  the archives
           list is also empty [default: null]
> archives - a list of .plt archives to unpack; any collections specified
            by the archives are set-up in addition to the collections
            listed in specific-collections  [default: null]

Thus, to unpack a single .plt archive "x.plt", set the `archives'
parameter to (list "x.plt") and leave `specific-collections' as null.

Link the options and setup units so that your option-setting code is
initialized between them, e.g.:

    (compound-unit/sig
      ...
      (link ...
            [OPTIONS : setup-option^ (setup:option@)]
            [MY-CODE : () (my-init-options@ OPTIONS)]
            [SETUP : () (setup@ OPTIONS ...)])
      ...)


_Getting info.ss fields_
========================

The _getinfo.ss_ module defines the following function:

> (get-info collection-names) -> (union #f (symbol (-> TST) -> TST))

   get-info accepts a list of strings naming a collection or
   sub-collection. It returns #f if there is no "info.ss" file in the
   collection. If the "info.ss" file has the wrong shape (i.e., not a
   module using (lib "infotab.ss" "setup")), or if the "info.ss" file
   fails to load, then an exception is raised. 

   Otherwise, `get-info' returns an info procedure of one or two
   arguments. The first argument to the info procedure is always a
   symbolic name, and the result is the value of the name in the
   "info.ss" file, if the name is defined. The optional second
   argument to the info procedure is a thunk that is called when the
   name is not defined, and the result of the info procedure is the
   result of the thunk in that case. If the name is not defined and no
   thunk is provided, then an exception is raised.


_.plt_ Archive Internals
==========================================================

NOTE: mzc can be used to create .plt files; see the mzc manual for
details. The internals of .plt archive files should be of little
interest to most users.

 Unpacking .plt Distribution Archives
 ------------------------------------

The extension ".plt" is not required for a distribution archive; this
convention merely helps users identify the purpose of a distribution
file.

The raw format of a distribution file is described below.  This format
is uncompressed and sensitive to communication modes (text
vs. binary), so the distribution format is derived from the raw format
by first compressing the file using gzip, then encoding the gzipped
file with the MIME base64 standard (which relies only the characters
A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, and =; all other characters are ignored when a
base64-encoded file is decoded).

The raw format is

 * "PLT" are the first three characters.

 * An like procedure that takes a symbol and a failure thunk and
   returns information about archive for recognized symbols. The
   information symbols are:

     + 'name - a human-readable string describing the archive's
       contents. This name is used only for printing messages to the
       user during unpacking.

     + 'unpacker - a symbol indicating the expected unpacking
       environment. Currently, the only allowed value is 'mzscheme.

     + 'requires - collections required to be installed before
       unpacking the archive, which associated versions; see the
       documentation of `pack' for details.

     + 'conflicts - collections required *not* to be installed before
       unpacking the archive

     + 'plt-relative? - a boolean; if true, then the archive's content
       should be unpacked relative to the plt installation directory.

   The procedure is extracted from the archive using MzScheme's `read'
   and `eval' procedures (in a fresh namespace).

 * An unsigned unit that drives the unpacking process. The unit accepts two
   imports: a path string for the plt directory and an `unmztar'
   procedure. The remainder of the unpacking process consists of invoking
   this unit. It is expected that the unit will call `unmztar' procedure to
   unpack directories and files that are defined in the input archive after
   this unit. The result of invoking the unit must be a list of collection
   paths (where each collection path is a list of strings); once the
   archive is unpacked, Setup PLT will compile and setup the specified
   collections, as if it was invoked with the "-c" option, so the
   "compiled" directories will be deleted.

   The `unmztar' procedure takes one argument: a filter
   procedure. The filter procedure is called for each directory and
   file to be unpacked. It is called with three arguments:

      + 'dir, 'file, 'file-replace - indicates whether the item to be
        unpacked is a directory, a file, or a file to be replaced;

      + a relative path string - the pathname of the directory or file
        to be unpacked, relative to the plt directory; and

      + a path string for the plt directory.

   If the filter procedure returns #f for a directory or file, the
   directory or file is not unpacked. If the filter procedure returns
   #t and the directory or file for 'dir or 'file already exists, it
   is not created. (The file for 'file-replace need not exist
   already.)

   When a directory is unpacked, intermediate directories are created
   as necessary to create the specified directory. When a file is
   unpacked, the directory must already exist.

   The unit is extracted from the archive using MzScheme's `read'
   and `eval' procedures.

Assuming that the unpacking unit calls the `unmztar' procedure, the
archive should continue with unpackables. Unpackables are extracted
until the end-of-file is found (as indicated by an `=' in the
base64-encoded input archive).

An unpackable is one of the following:

 * The symbol 'dir followed by a list. The `build-path' procedure
   will be applied to the list to obtain a relative path for the
   directory (and the relative path is combined with the plt directory
   path to get a complete path).

   The 'dir symbol and list are extracted from the archive using
   MzScheme's `read' (and the result is *not* `eval'uated).

 * The symbol 'file, a list, a number, an asterisk, and the file
   data. The list specifies the file's relative path, just as for
   directories. The number indicates the size of the file to be
   unpacked in bytes. The asterisk indicates the start of the file
   data; the next n bytes are written to the file, where n is the
   specified size of the file.

   The symbol, list, and number are all extracted from the archive
   using MzScheme's `read' (and the result is *not* `eval'uated).
   After the number is read, input characters are discarded until
   an asterisk is found. The file data must follow this asterisk
   immediately.

 * The symbol 'file-replace is treated like 'file, but if the file
   exists on disk already, the file in the archive replaces the file
   on disk.

 Making .plt archives
 --------------------

mzc supports the creation of simple .plt files (see the mzc manual for
details) but the setup collection's _pack.ss_ library provides more
general functions to help make .plt archives:

> (pack-collections collections dest name replace? extra-setup-collections)

  Creates the .plt file specified by the pathname `dest', using the
  string `name' as the name reported to Setup PLT as the archive's
  description.

  The archive contains the collections listed in `collections', which
  should be a list of collection paths; each collection path is, in
  turn, a list of relative-path strings.

  If `replace?' is #f, then attempting to unpack the archive will
  report an error when any of the collections exist already, otherwise
  unpacking the archive will overwrite an existing collection.

  The `extra-setup-collections' argument is a list of collection paths
  that are not included in the archive, but are set-up when the
  archive is unpacked.

> (pack dest name paths collections [filter encode? file-mode plt-relative? requires conflicts])

  Creates the .plt file specified by the pathname `dest', using the
  string `name' as the name reported to Setup PLT as the archive's
  description, and `collections' as the list of collection paths (to
  be compiled) returned by the unpacking unit. The `paths' argument
  must be a list of relative paths for directories and files; the
  contents of these files and directories will be packed into the
  archive.

  The `filter' procedure is called with the relative path of each
  candidate for packing. If it returns #f for some path, then that
  file or directory is omitted from the archive. If it returns 'file
  or 'file-replace for a file, the file is packed with that mode,
  rather than the default mode. The default `filter' is `std-filter'
  (defined below).
  
  If `encode?' is #f, then the output archive is in raw form, and
  still must be gzipped and mime-encoded (in that order). The default
  value is #t.

  The `file-mode' argument must be 'file or 'file-replace, indicating
  the default mode for a file in the archive. The default value is
  'file.

  If `plt-relative?', the archive's files and directories are to be
  unpacked relative to the plt installation directory.

  The `requires' argument should have the shape
      (list (list <coll-path> <version>) ...)
  where each <coll-path> is a non-empty list of relative-path strings,
  and each <version> is a (possibly empty) list of exact integers. The
  indicated collections must be installed at unpacking time, with
  version sequences that match as much of the version sequence
  specified in the corresponding <version>. A collection's version is
  indicated by the `version' field of it's info.ss file.

  The `conflicts' argument should have the shape
       (list <coll-path> ...)
  where each <coll-path> is a non-empty list of relative-path
  strings. The indicated collections must *not* be installed at
  unpacking time.

> (std-filter p) - returns #t unless `p' matches one of the following
  regular expressions: "CVS$", "compiled$", "~$", or "^#.*#$".

> (mztar path output filter file-mode) - called by `pack' to write one
   directory/file `path' to the output port `output' using the filter
   procedure `filter' (see `pack' for a description of `filter').  The
   `file-mode' argument specifies the default mode for packing a file,
   either 'file or 'file-replace.

 Unpacking .plt archives
 -----------------------

 The _plt-installer.ss_ library in the setup collection defines two
 procedures:

> (run-installer filename) - run the .plt installer on the .plt file in
  `filename' and show the output in a window.

> (on-installer-run thunk) - sets the on-installer-run thunk to
  `thunk'. The on-installer-run thunk is run after a .plt file is
  installed.

> (on-installer-run) - returns the on-installer-run thunk. The
  on-installer-run thunk is run after a .plt file is installed.

 The _plt-installer-unit.ss_ library in the setup collection returns a unit/sig
 that imports mred^ and exports setup:plt-installer^. The signature
 setup:plt-installer^ has two names: run-installer and on-installer-run, as
 above.

 The _plt-installer-sig.ss_ library defines the setup:plt-installer^
 signature, which has two names: run-installer and on-installer-run.
