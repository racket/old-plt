"Gobblet!" is a board game from Blue Orange Games,
www.blueorangegames.com.  The 3x3 version here correcponds to
"Gobblet! Jr.", while the 4x4 version is "Gobblet!".

The Blue Orange web site provides rules for Gobblet! Jr. and
Gobblet!. The rules below are in our own words, but see also the Blue
Orange version.


-- GAME RULES --

The 3x3 game is a generalization of tic-tac-toe:

 * The object of the game is to get 3 in a row of your color. Size
   doesn't matter for winning.

 * Each player (red or yellow) starts with 6 pieces: two large, two
   medium, and two small.

 * On each turn, a player can either place a new piece on the board,
   or move a piece already on the board (from anywhere to anywhere).

 * A piece can be placed (or moved to) an empty space, or it can be
   placed/moved on top of a smaller piece already on the board,
   "gobbling" the smaller piece.

 * Only visible pieces can be moved, and only visible pieces count
   toward winning. However, when a piece is moved, any piece that it
   gobbled stays put, and therefore becomes visible again.

 * If moving a piece exposes 3-in-a-row for the other player, and if
   the destination for the move does not cover up one of the other 2
   pieces in the 3-in-a-row, then the other play wins (even if the
   move makes 3-in-a-row for the moving player).

 * Technically, if a player touches a piece, then the piece must be
   moved on that turn. (In other words, you're not allowed to peek
   under a piece to remind yourself whether it gobbled anything.) If
   the piece can't be moved, the player forfeits. This particular rule
   is not enforced.

The 4x4 game has a few more rules:

 * The object of the game is to get 4 in a row of your color. Size
   doesn't matter for winning.

 * Each player (red or yellow) starts with 12 pieces: three large,
   three medium-large, three medium-small, and three small. These
   pieces are initially arranged into three stacks off the board.

 * On each turn, a player can either place a new piece on the board,
   or move a piece already on the board (from anywhere to anywhere).
   Only visible pieces can be moved onto the board (i.e., the initial
   stacks prevent playing small pieces before any large pieces).

 * A piece can be placed (or moved to) an empty space, or it can be
   placed/moved on top of a smaller piece already on the board,
   "gobbling" the smaller piece.

 * If a piece is not already on the board, it can gobble a piece
   already on the board only when the piece to gobble is part of 3 in
   a row.

 * Only visible pieces can be moved, and only visible pieces count
   toward winning. However, when a piece is moved, any piece that it
   gobbled stays put, and therefore becomes visible again.

 * Technically, if a player touches a piece, then the piece must be
   moved on that turn. (In other words, you're not allowed to peek
   under a piece to remind yourself whether it gobbled anything.) If
   the piece can't be moved, the player forfeits. This particular rule
   is not enforced.


-- INTERFACE --

Click and drag pieces in the obvious way. The shadow under a piece
shows where it will land when you drop it.

Use the arrow keys to rotate the board. Use "+" and "-" to zoom in and
out.
