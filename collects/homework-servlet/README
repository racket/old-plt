You will need:

1. A working installation of the PLT web-server. See help-desk
for details about setting up the web-server.

2. A directory where student homework submissions will be saved.

******************** Directory Structure ********************
For the sake of discussion, assume that the directory where homework
submissions are saved is called submission.

submission should contain two files and should have several sub-directories,
one sub-directory for each assignment.

1. File: student-accounts
This file contains the list of accounts used by the system.
See the sample student-accounts file for details.

2. File: graders
This file contains the list of graders.
See the sample graders file for details.

********** Assignment Directories **********
Each assignment directory must contain a file called assignment.
See the sample assignment file for details.

When students submit homework a subdirectory will be created beneath
the assignment directory to store their sumbission. The directory structure
looks like this:

/submission/<assignment-dir>/<graders name>/<students group>/<homework file(s)>

An information file will also be created when the student submits, which records
the names and ID's of all students in the group for which the submission was made.

******************** SETUP ********************
1. copy the file websubmit.scm to the servlets folder of your PLT
web-server installation. This is the script you specify in your browser
when you want to login to the submission system.

2. Edit the path in this file to point to your submission directory.

3.You may also want to edit the max/min-partners values. These values represent the number
of students in a partnership minus 1.

4. Copy the sample graders file to your submission directory and edit.

5. Copy the sample student-accounts file to your submission directory and edit.

6. Create directories for each of the assignments. You may add more later.

7. In each assignment directory, copy the sample assignment file to that directory
and edit.
