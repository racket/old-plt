- in the language dialog box, "allow set! on undefined" is ignored

- check syntax doesn't traverse unit or class expressions

- check syntax: identifiers with newlines in them have their arrows
  start from funny places.

- eval'ing images in drscheme is broken

- backup files don't preserve file permissions

- replace can't replace with an empty string (ie, deleting
  a word by finding it and replacing it with empty doesn't work)

- bad url's are not handled smoothly

- mred:console%'s initialization argument: `close-item?' is being ignored

- backup files don't preserve permissions

- the directory line in the common-file-dialogs is confusing

- embedded snips should be reset on the styles-fixed? ivar

- "scale" in open-viewport does effect the size
  of the viewport, but is ignored by at least
  draw-line into that viewport.
	
- you cannot break (read)

- pathnames should be normalized to early and can cause automouter problems

- control-l doesn't get the horizontal direction right.

- editor frames aren't gc'd when modified and search is open

* Windows: place windows neatly for "default" position instead of
   always placing them at 0, 0

* X Windows: modal dialogs can still be closed with the Window
   Manager

* X Windows and drawing into b & w bitmaps: black and white
  are reversed when using certain kinds of displays

* wx:dc%'s draw-arc is undefined when input isn't
  consistent with a circle

* wx:key-event% needs a set-position method

* Windows: set-user-scale with wx:memory-dc% doesn't work right

* MacOS: busy-cursor state is wrong for new windows when the
   busy cursor is active

* pasteboards: printing not yet implemented

* need to penalize the current thread more for certain primitive
   operations that can take a long time (e.g., loading a bitmap
   or saving a file)

* need range check for dc transfer modes

* need directory-selection dialog

* cursor changes to arrow over clickback after hitting it

* cursor does not change over clickbacks in embedded buffers

* Keys like KP_end, etc. are not currently accessible

* doc: [Mr] clarify "owning the caret" with respect to ownership by the parent, etc.

* doc: [Mr] "only valid when displayed": hyper-link to explanation.

* Motif: get-file dialog modality is wrong for eventspaces

* Windows and MacOS: "primitive" dialogs don't get closed by
   custodian-shutdown-all

* MacOS: std file dialog and print dialogs block MzScheme threads

* maliciously overriding set-admin can crash merge-snip and split-snip

* cut-n-paste within mred but across eventspaces breaks security and
  filesaving because snip class list is eventspace-specific

* how does wx:dc% get-size interact with the user scale?

* the full width for non-wrapped lines need not include the autowrap bitmap

* should use a guranteed offset for stippling in buffer redraws

* Xt: out-of-colours - widgets use too much black

* signature include: unbalanced parens => diverge?

* drag outisde view => should keep going even if mouse is still

* hidden files - add a MzScheme predicate?

* dragging selection shouldn't keep changing the auto-X-selection

* Xt: busy cursor not shown in the menu bar

* editor buffers should show a blinking caret

* Motif: menus don't work with multiple displays

* Motif: wxDialogBox doesn't obey current display for multiple displays

* add background colour for buffers?

* updating bug?: long flash, not on same line, update on focus-in

* add paragraph styles?

* need better de-fragmentation of text snips

* need to show a mystery snip icon when unknown data is loaded from a file

MzScheme
======================================================================

"synrule.ss" is missing `let-syntax' and `letrec-syntax'

`unit/sig' incorrectly handles syntax where defintions in the unit
 shadow syntactic forms

Under HP/UX, image --restore doesn't work

On Alpha machines, floating-point overflow is not handled properly
 (so +inf.0, -inf.0, and +nan.0 are messed up)

Under MacOS, `tcp-listen' does not work reliably

Under MacOS, in the standalone MzScheme application, a blocking read 
 from stdin blocks all MzScheme threads

Under Unix, (execute s) is just (exit (if (system s) 0 -1)), while
 execute* replaces the current process like it is supposed to

Under Windows, the `system' procedure blocks all MzScheme threads
 (`system*' works correctly)

Under AIX, write to tcp output port blocks when the low-level
  buffer is full

Under FreeBSD, if the descripters limit is greater than 256, then
  it is automatically reduced to 256 within MzScheme/MrEd/DrScheme

Still to be added to support R5RS:
  (scheme-report-environment n)
  (null-environment n)
  (interaction-environment)
  (port? v)
