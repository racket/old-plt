MrEd 100 Framework revision

The framework is a streamlined version of the `mred:' names
from MrEd version 53.

Several of the old classes and proecedures are not longer in the
framework. Some have been eliminated and some have been moved out
into a separate application. Use 

   mred -l "app.ss" "system" "oldstyle.ss" "framework"

to start old-style mred.

The eliminated classes and functions are:

  :: classes that used to improve the wx: toolbox 
  :: interface and are no longer needed

  mred:basic-mode% 
  mred:button% 
  mred:check-box% 
  mred:choice% 
  mred:dialog-box% 
  mred:edit% (only the name is gone; mred:file-edit lives on)
  mred:frame%
  mred:gauge% 
  mred:horizontal-panel%
  mred:list-box%
  mred:message% 
  mred:multi-text% 
  mred:panel% 
  mred:radio-box%
