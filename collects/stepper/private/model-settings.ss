  ; there are two separate reasons to use units here, but it's just too painful.
  ; reason 1) the drscheme:language procedures are linked at runtime into the
  ; stepper-tool unit, and we need to get them down here somehow.  Making the
  ; render-settings a unit would solve this.
  ; reason 2) the render-settings should be recomputed once for each stepper 
  ; invocation.  invoke-unit is a nice way of doing this without dropping back
  ; to linking-by-position, which is what happens with a simple closure 
  ; implementatian.
  
  ; HOWEVER, like I said, it's just too painful. Once this is a unit, then 
  ; everything else wants to be a unit too. For instance, to make sure that 
  ; the reconstructor gets the right invocation of the unit, it needs to be a 
  ; unit as well.  Pretty soon, everything is units.
