The utilities in this directory try to help in linking external C++
code into MzScheme. The utilities are now deprecated, but they're
still used to build MrEd.

xctocc is decribed in the manual "PLT xctocc: C++ Glue Generator
Manual" (available on request). xcglue.c and xcglue.h are used by the
code generated by xctocc.
