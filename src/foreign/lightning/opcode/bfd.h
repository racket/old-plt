/* bfd.h -- The only header file required by users of the bfd library 

The bfd.h file is generated from bfd-in.h and various .c files; if you
change it, your changes will probably be lost.

All the prototypes and definitions following the comment "THE FOLLOWING
IS EXTRACTED FROM THE SOURCE" are extracted from the source files for
BFD.  If you change it, someone oneday will extract it from the source
again, and your changes will be lost.  To save yourself from this bind,
change the definitions in the source in the bfd directory.  Type "make
docs" and then "make headers" in that directory, and magically this file
will change to reflect your changes.

If you don't have the tools to perform the extraction, then you are
safe from someone on your system trampling over your header files.
You should still maintain the equivalence between the source and this
file though; every change you make to the .c file should be reflected
here.  */
