Notes:

1) emailed Robby regarding problems with rendering OL, UL, and background
color attribute for BODY.
	a) OL and UL require somewhat sophisticated machinery
	b) overriding on-paint for text% has refresh issues, as well as white border outside of viewable area

2) gui-framework.ss 
   * browser-frame% overrides on-subwindow-char method; passes all keyboard events directly to the receiver; doesn't intercept anything.
     Prefer to pass ENTER to TEXT-FIELD receivers, but otherwise act normally.
