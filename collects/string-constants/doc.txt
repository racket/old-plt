_String Constants_

This library provides the facility for multiple
langauges in DrScheme's GUI. These are the exported
syntactic forms and procedures:
        
> (string-constant name) : string
 
   This form returns the string constant named `name'.
   
> (string-constants name) : (listof string)

  This form returns a list of string constants, one for each
  language that DrScheme's GUI supports.
  
> (this-language) : string

  This form returns the name of the current language
  
> (all-languages) : (listof string)

  This form returns a list of strings (in the same order as
  those returned from string-constants) naming each
  language.

> (set-language-pref lang) : void

  Sets the language for the next run of DrScheme to
  lang, which must be a string. Does not affect the 
  running DrScheme.
  
============================================================

To add string-constants to DrScheme, see the files:

  _english-string-constants.ss_
  _french-string-constants.ss_
  _spanish-string-constants.ss_
  _german-string-constants.ss_
  
Each file has the same format. When `read',
they produce a list of lists of length two.
Each inner list is contains a symbol that names
the string constant and a string, in the appropriate
langauge. The english-string-constants.ss is considered
the master file -- string constants will be set there
and translated into each of the other langauge files.
In addition, the english-string-constants.ss file 
should contain hints about the context of the strings
whose symbol name might not be clear.
