allow easy addition of break points and stepping of the testcases.

copy-paste:
aligned pasteboards are going haywire when the get inserted from a save
or copy-paste operation.
Status: I don't know if it's working because the insertion of the pasteboards
        so messed up.

pasteboard: robby
Improve layout, Insertion look good, Make responsive:

rename-call:
the word call is just plain confusing. I need to give it a better name.

string-constants:
I need to use the string constants

eof:
eof on no value. This is no longer a problem because I don't allow empty
boxes but it'd probablly be a good idea to understand why it contains
this 3D value.

namespace: robby
Adding the test-case macro to the top-level require makes test-cases in
modules not see the macro and fail to execute. Test-cases don't work in
beginner level because require makes no sence.

mouse-cursor: important
If you mouse down on a text box and mouse up in another, the cursor
appears in the second text box.

mouse-off: important, robby
If you mouse down on a button snip and move the mouse off, the button
stays depressed.

keys-presses: important
If you press control-z or control-y in the test-cases you can undo some of
the inserts and even see some of the snip handles when stuff gets uninserted
