
This is the PLT software package directory. 

The main executables are:
  plt\drscheme\drscheme.exe - DrScheme starter
  plt\mred\mred.exe - This executable is used by drscheme.exe
  plt\mzscheme\mzscheme.exe - Text-based Scheme interpreter, not
   used by mred.exe or drscheme.exe
Depending on which distribution you downloaded, you may have fewer
executables.

Documentation
-------------

Most of the PLT documentation must be downloaded separately from the
executables. (The exception is the DrScheme manual, which is accessed
within DrScheme through the "Help" button.)

HTML documentation for PLT software should be installed into
plt\doc. For example, the DrScheme documenation should be in
plt\doc\drscheme, with button icons in plt\doc\icons.  MrEd will
automatically add sections installed here to its "Help" menu.
