This is the source code for MysterX.  Compilation requires 
Visual Studio .NET.

	nmake clean

gets rid of existing binaries, while 

	nmake

compiles all the binaries.

In the Makefile, there are several variables to set:

  o MZC - path to the mzc compiler
  o HTMLHELP - directory for MS Help Workshop
  o SHELL32 - directory containing LIB/SHELL32.LIB
     and related header files
  o REGSVR32 - path to the REGSVR32 utility

You may need to change these according to your local
installation before compiling.  The REGSVR32 utility
is ordinarily located in the Windows\SYSTEM directory
under Windows 95/98, and in the WINNT\System32 directory
under Windows NT/2000/XP.

If you get errors about a missing file atlbase.h,
check the value of the environment variable INCLUDE.
The subdirectory `atlmfc' (VS.NET) beneath 
the Visual C++ directory needs to be in the list of INCLUDE 
directories.  For example, if Visual Studio .NET is installed 
at the root of the C: drive, that directory would be

  C:\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Vc7\atlmfc

The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop must be installed to
build mxmain.dll.  The files are on the Visual Studio
CD in the directory HTMLHELP in the file HTMLHELP.EXE.  Run
that program to install the files.  Alternatively, Help 
Workshop may be downloaded from the Web, at

 http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?

[The above URL is broken over two lines for readability.]
Windows 2000 comes with HTML Help installed (probably 
Windows XP Professional does as well.)
