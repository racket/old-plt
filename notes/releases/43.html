<p>
The following is a summary of the changes in this release
from the previous one.

<h4> DrScheme </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Added a "Preferences" item on the "Edit" menu.<tt> </tt>
The "DrScheme" category allows selection of the subset of Scheme
from purely functional Scheme (no set!, etc) to (almost)
fully R4RS Scheme.

<li>
The Scheme primitives can now be redefined, and there is no longer
a restriction on using names that begin with "zodiac:".

<li> 
These syntactic forms not yet supported:<tt> </tt>
do without the step form, vector constants inside quasiquote, local,
and define-structure (use define-struct instead).

<li>
Significant internal restructuring of the GUI tools DrScheme uses
to make windows, panels, buttons, etc.
</ul>

<h4> Syntax Checker </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Added a Syntax Checker and Colorizer.

<li>
Go to the "Tools" menu and click on "Syntax Checker."<tt> </tt>
Then, clicking on the "Check Syntax" button will highlight
syntax errors and (on some platforms) color the program according 
to free and bound identifiers, syntactic forms, constants, etc.
</ul>

<h4> Debugger </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Added early support for a Debugger.

<li> 
After loading a file, click on "Debug."<tt> </tt>
Then, clicking on the beginning of an expression (a "Hotspot")
will enable setting breakpoints and recording history 
information.<tt> </tt>
Better documentation is planned for release 44.

<li>
<i>Note:</i><tt> </tt>
The Debugger currently doesn't handle syntax errors very well.<tt> </tt>
So, first make sure that the program passes "Check Syntax" before
running the Debugger.
</ul>

<h4> Stepper </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Added support for let, let*, letrec, call/cc and improper arguments
in lambda.

<li>
Added Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete to the Edit menu.<tt> </tt>
Copy and Paste also work between the Stepper and DrScheme.
</ul>

<h4> Analysis </h4>

<ul>
<li>
The Analysis tool (MrSpidey) is temporarily unavailable in 
releases 43 and 44 and will reappear in a future release.
</ul>

<h4> Known Problems </h4>

<ul>
<li>
On some platforms (Macintosh and Microsoft Windows), the Syntax Checker
and the Debugger do not display the program in color.

<li>
On the Macintosh, the Debugger window is too small, and the Hotspot
window does not pop up correctly.
</ul>
