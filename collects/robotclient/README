Our entry is written in the mzscheme dialect of Scheme.

Our player uses a breadth-first-search to plan paths to homes and
package destinations.  If other robots are nearby, a weighted
heuristic search kicks in to figure out the interaction with the other
robot.

Our runme is a shell script that invokes a mzscheme executable, we
have assumed that the path to the mzscheme executable is
"/usr/local/bin/mzscheme".  If this is not the case, please alter the
first line of the runme script with the appropriate location.
