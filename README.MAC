This is the PLT software package folder. Setup-----Some setup is required only if you DID NOT download a Stuffit archive,you did not download the source code archive, and you did not usesuntar to unpack the .tar archive. In that case, un-MacBinary thefollowing files:   plt:DrScheme.bin   plt:DrScheme Jr.bin   plt:MrEd.XXX.bin   plt:MzScheme.XXX.bin   plt:Setup PLT.bin   plt:mzc.bin   plt:collects:launcher:MzStarter.bin   plt:collects:launcher:MrStarter.binwhere "XXX" is "68k" or "PPC". You may not have some of these files, depending on which distribution you downloaded.Applications------------The following are the applications:  plt:Help Desk --- for Help  plt:DrScheme -- PLT's main Scheme development environment  plt:DrScheme Jr -- A simple text-based DrScheme  plt:MrEd -- a Scheme GUI engine  plt:MzScheme -- a text-based Scheme interpreter  plt:bin:mzc -- the MzScheme compilerDrScheme relies on MrEd (i.e., the DrScheme application launchesMrEd with special startup instructions), and DrScheme Jr and mzc relyon MzScheme. You may not have some of these applications, dependingon which distribution you downloaded.DrScheme needs a lot of memory - at least 24MB. Give the MrEdapplication as much memory as possible for its partition (i.e., setthe application size using the "Get Info" dialog in Finder.)Compiling---------If you downloaded the source code distribution instead of the standarddistribution, you must compile MzScheme and MrEd before using the PLTsoftware (including DrScheme). For compilation instructions, unpack the Compactor archiveplt:src:cw.cpt, producing plt:src:cw. Read the ABOUT files inplt:src:cw.If there is no plt:src:mzscheme folder, you did not downloadthe source code distribution. In that case, you should be ready torun.More Information----------------Run plt:Help Desk for further information.
