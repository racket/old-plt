Will "Insert Test Case" eventually move to the "Special" menu?
Perhaps "Enable Test Cases" goes in the "Scheme" menu?

Is it possible to make the Test Suite menu just have a single word?
It's confusing to look at with a space in the middle. Perhaps "Test"

Probably the "Enable Test Cases" should not be a checkable menu item,
but should change it's label between "Enable All Test Cases" and
"Disable All Test Cases".

multiview:
It'd be cool to allow multiple views of the test suite

errorboxes: future
Need to have boxes that handle errors.

output:
need to handle output (side effect) of test calls

stepper: future
allow easy addition of break points and stepping of the testcases.

language-pref: future
Make a language level preference to execute or not execute the test cases.
Maybe just do it in debug mode?

disable: future
add a button to disable a test case.

string-constants:
I need to use the string constants

namespace: robby
Adding the test-case macro to the top-level require makes test-cases in
modules not see the macro and fail to execute. Test-cases don't work in
beginner level because require makes no sence.

mouse-cursor: important
If you mouse down on a text box and mouse up in another, the cursor
appears in the second text box.

mouse-off: important, robby
If you mouse down on a button snip and move the mouse off, the button
stays depressed.

keys-presses: important
If you press control-z or control-y in the test-cases you can undo some of
the inserts and even see some of the snip handles when stuff gets uninserted

This may be the same as what you describe below, but when I type this:
(let loop () (loop)) into a test case window and then type more close
parens after that, things vibrate in a strange way.

test-suite entry boxes are not locked when the program is executing
