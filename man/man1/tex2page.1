.SH NAME

TeX2page \- TeX document to Web page converter 

.SH SYNOPSIS

tex2page { --help | --version | \fIfilename\fP }

.SH DESCRIPTION

tex2page makes Web pages from LaTeX and plain-TeX
documents.  
.PP
The command
.RS
tex2page doc.tex
.RE
converts the TeX source file doc.tex to the HTML
file doc.html, with possibly some auxiliary HTML
files and some image files.  The argument
filename can be a full or relative pathname.  If the
latter, it is reckoned relative to the current
directory.  The extension may be omitted if it is .tex. 
.PP
In order to resolve cross-references, it may be
necessary to invoke tex2page a couple of times.
The log displayed on the console will inform you
if such is the case.  This log is also saved in the
file with the same basename as the input TeX file but
with extension .hlog.
.PP
If tex2page is called without an argument, or if the file
named by the argument doesn't exist,
tex2page prints a brief help message and exits.  
.PP
The complete documentation for tex2page is included in
the tex2page distribution, and may also be viewed on
the Web at

.SH OPTIONS

tex2page can be called with the following options
instead of an argument filename.
.TP
--help
Print help message and exit.
.TP
--version
Print version information and exit.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP
TEXINPUTS
tex2page uses the same search path as TeX
to search for 
\einput and \eopenin files.  The default search path is
implementation-dependent but can be changed by setting 
the environment variable TEXINPUTS to a list of
colon-separated directories.  (If you wish to
merely prepend your list to the default list, end your
list with a colon.)  Add two trailing forward slashes
to any directory in TEXINPUTS that you want to
recursively search all subdirectories of.
.TP
TIIPINPUTS
tex2page will use a search path specified in the
environment variable TIIPINPUTS
instead of TEXINPUTS, if TIIPINPUTS exists.
TIIPINPUTS  
does not support the double-slash mechanism of
TEXINPUTS.
.TP
TEXEDIT
If tex2page encounters a fatal error in the document,
you can type e to edit the offending file at the 
line containing the error.  The editor call can
be specified as a string value assigned to the
environment variable TEXEDIT, with %d standing 
for the line number and %s for the filename.  
.TP
EDITOR
If TEXEDIT is not set, $EDITOR is chosen as the editor.
If EDITOR is also not set, "vi" is chosen as the editor.  
The
editor is
called with the arguments " +n f", where n is the 
line number and f is the
filename.

.SH FILES
.TP 
jobname.hdir, .tex2page.hdir, ~/.tex2page.hdir

By default, tex2page generates its output HTML files 
in the current directory.  You can specify a different
directory by naming it in the file jobname.hdir in the
current directory, the file .tex2page.hdir in the current
directory, or the file .tex2page.hdir in your home
directory.  The first of these files that exists is
considered.
.sp 1
The name
can be or contain the TeX control-sequence \ejobname,
which expands to the basename of the input file.
.PP
.TP 
jobname.t2p

Before processing a TeX source file whose basename is
jobname, tex2page will automatically load the file 
jobname.t2p, if it exists.  jobname.t2p is a good place
to put macros that are specific to the HTML version of 
the document.

.SH SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

tex2page runs on Scheme or Common Lisp.  It may 
also make
use of the following programs: BibTeX, MakeIndex,
Ghostscript, Dvips, and the NetPBM library.
.PP
Out of the box, tex2page runs in MzScheme, but
the distribution includes configuration information
to allow tex2page to run on a variety of Scheme 
and Common Lisp implementations.
