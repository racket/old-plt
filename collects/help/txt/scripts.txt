_Scripts under Windows_

Under Windows, you can create executable batch files containing
Scheme code.  Such batch files can be run from the command
prompt or loaded directly into DrScheme.

A batch file has the extension .BAT.  The form of the batch
file is

        ; @echo off
        ; mzscheme.exe -r %0 %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
        ; goto :end

        <Scheme code here>

        ; :end

Only nine (9) command-line parameters to the batch file are allowed.
That restriction is a limitation of MS-DOS.
