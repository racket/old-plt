I think that there is too much whitespace around the boxes, too. It'd           
be nicer to use color to separate the lines and get back some screen
"real estate".

First use experience report: Pls:                                          
                                                            
1. automatically associate the test suite with the current file name
   (from where you launched "new test suite").                      
                                                                    
2. enable tab to move from "slot" to slot                           
                                                                                
3. make "actual" visibly different so that people know you can't fill
   it in ... :-)                                                     
                                                                     
4. the teachpacks need to be included in the execution               
                                                                     
5. when you detect an error during execution, also hi-lite the source  
   of the error in the DrScheme window.

One thing I noticed about your tester: it doesn't seem to use Robby's
string-constants system.  So all the menus and buttons and stuff you
have will always be in English, which will look weird to people who
use DrScheme with another language.

Make the save button come up when the program to test is changed.
Make the save button not come up when a test-suite is just loaded.

Hide caret in the error display text
