Give better error message on bad file loading.(message box?)
disallow newlines in program to file box

override on-default-event of the pasteboard if it's not needed
so that all the funny selection and movement doesn't happen.

One thing I noticed about your tester: it doesn't seem to use Robby's
string-constants system.  So all the menus and buttons and stuff you
have will always be in English, which will look weird to people who
use DrScheme with another language.

Make the save button come up when the program to test is changed.
Make the save button not come up when a test-suite is just loaded.
-------------------
Give a better error message with highlighting when there are too many
expressions in a test box.
-------------------
Scroll to off screen test cases when tabbing
  fix this so that it if a snip ever gets focus it gets scrolled to
  i.e. when I mouse select a snip that is partially visible it does
  not come into view.
-------------------
- add a button next to browse that opens the tested file in DrScheme
  (handler:open-file or finder:open-file in the framework does
  everying for you)

Some suggestions after playing a little while:

 * Disable the "Delete" button when it doesn't apply. It should also be
   more clear which entry will be deleted. For example, move the
   keyboard focus to the "Browse" area, go away for an hour, come back,
   and click "Delete".

 * There's a problem with handling mouse-button releases. They seem to
   be handled like clicks. For example, drag a selection in "Expected",
   but release the mouse in "Call". The selection will move to "Call".

give the language menu a separtor so it looks just like the drscheme
window menu
