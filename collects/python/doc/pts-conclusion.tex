\label{conclusion}

The Python-to-Scheme compiler translates Python programs into their Scheme equivalents.  The lexer and parser read and check the syntactic correctess of such programs.  The code generator turns the parser's output of syntactic elements into Scheme code.  The generated Scheme code uses the runtime system, which models the Python environment.  This allows Python programmers to take advantage of DrScheme and its development tools while writing in their preferred language.  The benefit to Scheme programmers comes by way of Python libraries, which are increasingly numerous.
