wxWindows Utilities
-------------------

colours         A colour sampler for wxWindows.

dib             Various Windows BMP routines. In the default wxWindows
                setup, this code is used to implement some wxBitmap
                loading/saving methods.

hytext          A simple hypertext window class (used in wxHelp).

image           wxImage class for X *ONLY*. In the default wxWindows
                setup, this code is used to implement some wxBitmap
                loading methods. Don't try compiling this under
                Windows.

mfutils         A start at machine-independent Windows Metafile
                reading code.

prologio        File loading and saving utilities, as used by
                wxBuilder and the .wxr resource loading code.
                Included in the wxWindows .lib or .a library
                by default.

rcparser        Parses Windows resource files, and loads .ico and
                .cur files. Included in the wxWindows library by
                default.

tex2rtf         The tool used to maintain wxWindows documentation
                in multiple formats. Generates HTML, WinHelp RTF,
                linear RTF and wxHelp files from simplified LaTeX
                files. Also available separately from AIAI's ftp site.

winstall        An easy-to-use Windows application installation utility.

wxbuild         wxBuilder; the wxWindows screen-painter/code generator.

wxgraph         A graph layout algorithm (nodes and arcs, not bar
                charts!).

wxtree          A tree layout algorithm.

xpmshow         An XPM<->BMP conversion program. Works best under
                Windows. wxXPM must be compiled into wxWindows for
                this to compile properly.
