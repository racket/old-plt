   General architecture:

   Each allocation is for either tagged or untagged memory. Untagged
   memory must be either atomic or an array of pointers. Heterogenous
   memory is always tagged. After alocating a tagged object, MzScheme
   is responsible for setting the tag before a collection occurs. The
   tag is always a `short' value at the beginning of the

   MzScheme supplies a traversal procedure for every tag value. The
   traversal takes two arguments, an allocated object and a procedure
   pointer, and returns the size of the object in words (not bytes!),
   which is not necessarily fixed for a particular tag. If the
   procedure pointer supplied to the traverser is not NULL, it must
   also call the given procedure on every pointer stored in the
   object, via the gcMARK_HERE macro described below.

   The value of a pointer can refer to a GCable object, to the middle
   of a GCable object, or to some other point in memory. It might also
   be a fixnum value, which has 1 in the least-significant bit,
   whereas actual pointers are always 2-byte-aligned. Thus, when
   moving GCable objects in a copying collector, the collector must
   modify pointers to objects or to the middle of objects, but leave
   other pointers and fixnums alone.

   At any point when the allocator/collector is invoked, MzScheme will
   have set the GC_variable_stack variable to indicate a chain of
   local pointer variables on the stack (i.e., both the chain of
   record and the pointer variables themselves are on the stack). The
   GC_variable_stack global points to a value of the form

     struct {
        void *next_frame;
        long frame_size;
        void **pointers[...];
     }

   where the size of `pointers' is indicated by `frame_size'. Each
   element of `pointers' is the address of a pointer of the stack.
   The `next_frame' field in the structure gives the address of the
   next frame on the stack, and so on. The garbage collector should
   follow the chain of frames, adjusting pointers for copying
   collection, until it reaches a frame that is deeper than the value
   returned by GC_get_thread_stack_base() (which is supplied by
   MzScheme).

   More generally, GC_mark_variable_stack() can be used to GC a stack
   that has been copied into the heap. See below for more details.  */

   MzScheme can change `value' at any time; when a collection happens,

   `level' refers to an ordering of finalizers. It can be 1 or

   all objects queued for finalization are marked as live and
