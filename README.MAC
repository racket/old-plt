This is the PLT software package folder.--------------------------------------------------------------------This ONLY applies if you DID NOT get a Stuffit archive, or you didnot use suntar to extract the .tar archive  Now that you have managed to unpack the archive, you STILL  have to un-MacBinary these files:   :plt:drscheme:DrScheme.bin (only in the DrScheme or PLT package)   :plt:mred:MrEd.bin          (needed for DrScheme)   :plt:mzscheme:MzScheme.bin  (not needed for MrEd/DrScheme)--------------------------------------------------------------------Once unpacked, these are the applications:  :plt:mzscheme:MzScheme -- a text-based Scheme interpreter  :plt:mred:MrEd  -- a Scheme GUI development environmentDrScheme is implemented through MrEd and uses the MrEd application.The file  :plt:drscheme:DrSchemeis a MrEd file. Double-click on it (or drag it onto the MrEd icon)to start up DrScheme.--------------------------------------------------------------------DrScheme needs a lot of memory - at least 24MB. Give the MrEdapplication as much memory as possible for its partition (i.e., setthe application size using the "Get Info" dialog in Finder.)--------------------------------------------------------------------Most of the PLT documentation must be downloaded separately from theexecutables. (The exception is the DrScheme manual, which is accessedwithin DrScheme through the "Help" button.)HTML documentation for PLT software should be installed into:plt:doc. For example, the DrScheme documenation should be in:plt:doc:drscheme, with button icons in :plt:doc:icons.  MrEd willautomatically add sections installed here to its "Help" menu.--------------------------------------------------------------------For more information, see  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/
