MysterX test control
====================

The file mystests.ss in this directory creates a window
with a test ActiveX control, and runs a number of tests on it.
After the internal tests are performed, you can interact 
with the test control using a mouse.

The C++ code in the src subdirectory is supplied uncompiled.
You need Visual C++ 6.0 to compile it.  You may need to 
change the directory for MZC in testobject.mak if you have
installed PLT software to a nonstandard location.

To compile, run "nmake".  Once you've compiled the test ActiveX 
control, load "mystests.ss".
