SYSTEM HISTORY
--------------
Version 49:
- if your application is unititized, then you need to change the
  startup procedure. See the application startup section in the
  toolbox manual.

Version 47:
- find-string-embedded of mred:edit% is just like find-string except it
  searches in embedded buffers as well.
- mred:frame-name is gone, use app-name in the application unit instead,
  which is documented under the `Starting Up' section of the toolbox
  manual.
- the signature mred:application^ now contains the variable app-name.

Version 46:
- pretty-print-out is gone, use display-result instead, if you want to
  display results

Version 45:
- frame groups no longer set the frame title prefix
- there is a new edit%, mred:return-edit%. It takes an extra arg at
  initialization time, which should be a function that will be called
  when the user types return in the edit.
- takeover-output is now takeover and release-output is gone.
  In the next release this should become obsolete
- there are now two new methods of simple-menu-frame%'s, 
  get-edit and get-canvas. These return the current "main" edit and canvas
  in the frame. They should be used for saving, reverting, etc. If your
  frame can have more than one "main" edit then override get-edit and 
  get-canvas and have them return the current main canvas. Note that
  this is different from active-canvas and active-edit. Those two functions
  may return *any* visible edit in the frame, eg one of the searching edits
  in the bottom of the frame, that appear while searching. 
  active-edit and active-canvas should be used for things like pasting 
  and copying, which should apply to all edits, not just "important" or "main"
  ones.
- mred:simple-frame-canvas% and mred:editor-canvas% are now obsolete.
  Instead there are now three important canvas classes in the system:
  mred:wrapping-canvas% : 
    handles autowrapping, can create edits automatically, uses
    style-flags ivar and style initialization for default styles to
    super-init, and implements edit-modifited and edit-renamed
  mred:one-line-canvas% 
    is just the right height to display one line of text.
    inherits from mred:wrapping-canvas%
  mred:frame-title-canvas%
    updates the title of the frame when it recieves focus
    events. inherits from mred:wrapping-canvas%
- all of the "connection maintenence" ie edits that know which canvses
  they are in, frames that know which canvas is the most recently
  active canvas have been moved into into separate classes that only
  maintain those connections, mred:connections-media-edit%,
  mred:connections-media-canvas%, mred:connections-frame%,
  mred:connections-dialog-box%, and mred:connections-panel%
- all instance variables class% (e.g. edit% and canvas% on frames) 
  have been changed to get-class%, to support inheiritance.
- added extra optional arg to mred:local-busy-cursor and
  mred:show-busy-cursor that specifies the timeout
- frame title prefixes are now handled by the frame, and
  the set-frame-prefix and set-frame-title methods correctly
  update the graphical frame with it's new title.

Version 44:
- .html files (with file: links) are supported
- system now provides and uses a better dialog buildling classes. 
  See toolbox manual for more info
- changed do-eval and do-save-and-eval-or-read-avail
  to accept a range in the edit rather than a string
- added read-snips/chars-from-buffer, a function that takes an edit and 
  produces a thunk. That thunk returns either a snip or a character, for
  each character and non-text snip in the edit.  
- added a check so that edits will now save themselves in mred's format
  if there are non-text snips in the edit.

Version 43:
- replaced search dialogue
- new application startup procedure
- mred:frame% changed to mred:editor-frame%
- mred:canvas% changed to mred:editor-canvas%
- mred:console-frame renamed to mred:console
- mred:console-edit and mred:console-canvas gone, use
  (ivar mred:console edit) and (ivar mred:console canavs)
- expanded keybindings -- most movement keys now
  have a shifted form that selects text
- added mred:standard-menus-frame% which gets the right keybindings for
  the different platforms
