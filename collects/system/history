SYSTEM HISTORY
--------------
Version 45:

- mred:simple-frame-canvas% and mred:editor-canvas% are now obsolete.
  Instead there are now three important canvas classes in the system:
  mred:wrapping-canvas% : 
    handles autowrapping, can create edits automatically, uses
    style-flags ivar and style initialization for default styles to
    super-init, and implements edit-modifited and edit-renamed
  mred:one-line-canvas% 
    is just the right height to display one line of text.
    inherits from mred:wrapping-canvas%
  mred:frame-title-canvas%
    updates the title of the frame when it recieves focus
    events. inherits from mred:wrapping-canvas%
			
- all of the "connection maintenence" ie edits that know which canvses
  they are in, frames that know which canvas is the most recently
  active canvas have been moved into into separate classes that only
  maintain those connections, mred:connections-media-edit%,
  mred:connections-media-canvas%, mred:connections-frame%,
  mred:connections-dialog-box%, and mred:connections-panel%
- all instance variables class% (e.g. edit% and canvas% on frames) 
  have been changed to get-class%, to support inheiritance.
- added extra optional arg to mred:local-busy-cursor and
  mred:show-busy-cursor that specifies the timeout
- frame title prefixes are now handled by the frame, and
  the set-frame-prefix and set-frame-title methods correctly
  update the graphical frame with it's new title.

Version 44:
- .html files (with file: links) are supported
- system now provides and uses a better dialog buildling classes. 
  See toolbox manual for more info
- changed do-eval and do-save-and-eval-or-read-avail
  to accept a range in the edit rather than a string
- added read-snips/chars-from-buffer, a function that takes an edit and 
  produces a thunk. That thunk returns either a snip or a character, for
  each character and non-text snip in the edit.  
- added a check so that edits will now save themselves in mred's format
  if there are non-text snips in the edit.

Version 43:
- replaced search dialogue
- new application startup procedure
- mred:frame% changed to mred:editor-frame%
- mred:canvas% changed to mred:editor-canvas%
- mred:console-frame renamed to mred:console
- mred:console-edit and mred:console-canvas gone, use
  (ivar mred:console edit) and (ivar mred:console canavs)
- expanded keybindings -- most movement keys now
  have a shifted form that selects text
- added mred:standard-menus-frame% which gets the right keybindings for
  the different platforms
