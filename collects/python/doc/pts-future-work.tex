In order to complete the compiler, a mechanism must be devised to dynamically load (through the \verb{import} statement, section~\ref{importzzzstmtb}) low-level Python libraries written in C, including the core library from CPython.  This matter is currently under investigation, as are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item completion of an automated test suite;
\item generation of better error messages;
\item implementation of \synt{yield_stmt} (Section~\ref{yieldzzzstmtb});
\item implementation of \synt{exec_stmt} (Section~\ref{execzzzstmtb}); and
\item handling of default function parameters (Section~\ref{functions}).
\end{itemize}
