The stepper no longer works with the "Intermediate" language.
More accurately, perhaps, the Intermediate language is no 
longer compatible with the stepper.  

The stepper doesn't handle 'include' provided as a teachpack
element.

Primitives like 'make-number/make-numeric' that are renamed
as module provides are not displayed using their renamed
names.

'And' expressions containing subexpressions which don't
evaluate to booleans are not reduced correctly.

Inexact numbers are not printed with a leading #i.
