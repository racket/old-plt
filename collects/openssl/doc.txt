The _openssl_ collection provides glue for the OpenSSL library with the
MzScheme port system. It has been tested under Linux, FreeBSD and Max OS/X.
The OpenSSL collection functions nearly identically to the standard network
subsystems, with a few additional flags. It currently exports the following
three objects:

Like ssl-connect, but breaking is enabled while trying to connect. 

> ssl-available? 

A boolean value which says whether the system openssl library was successfully 
loaded. Calling ssl-connect or ssl-connect/enable-break when this value is #f 
(library not loaded) will raise an error.

> (ssl-connect hostname port [flag])

Connect to the given host (a string) on the given port (a number from 1 to
65535). This encryption will be encrypted using SSL. The optional flag 
determines which encryption protocol is used. At the current time, the flag,
if given, must be one of: 'sslv2-or-v3 (SSL protocol versions 2 or 3, as
appropriate; this is the default), 'sslv2 (SSL protocol version 2), 'sslv3
(SSL protocol version 3), or 'tls (the TLS protocol version 1). The return
values are as tcp-connect; an input port and an output port. 

> (ssl-connect/enable-break hostname port [flag])
