** To play _Same_, run the Games application. **

The object of Same is to score points by removing dots from the
board. To remove a dot, click on it. As long as there is another dot
of the same color next to the clicked dot, it will disappear along
with all adjacent dots of the same color. After the dots disappear,
dots in the rows above the deleted dots will fall into the vacated
spaces. If an entire column is wiped out, all of the dots from the
right will slide left to take up the empty column's space.

Your score increases for each ball removed from the board. The score
for each click is a function of the number of balls that
disappeared. The "This Click" label shows how many points you would
score for clicking the dots underneath the mouse pointer. The score
varies quadratically with the number of balls, so eliminating many
balls with one click is advantageous.
