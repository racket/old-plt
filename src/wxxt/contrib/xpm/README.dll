Hi,							     10th October `95

THE SHARED LIBRARY INCLUDED IS FOR DLL X11R6 (XFree86-3.1.x) AND ELF.

To build, just type the following standard steps...

	% xmkmf
	% make Makefiles
	% make

That should build everything - i.e the shared DLL library, the stub, the
static library and the sxpm executable. If you have the ELF development
environment in place (i.e. the ELF X11 libs) then it will built the ELF
library instead.

The changes I made are the inclusion of the lib/jump directory and its
contents and also lib/Imakefile and lib/Imakefile.dll for the DLL building
procedure. Do a diff on lib/Imakefile and lib/Imakefile.org to see the
changes.

From now on the DLL library numbering procedure will follow the SOXPMLIBREV
scheme. Look in lib/xpm.h for more info.

To install: (from this directory):

For both:
	% cp lib/xpm*.h /usr/X11R6/include/X11
For ELF:
	% cp elf/* /usr/X11R6/lib
For a.out:
	% cp a.out/* /usr/X11R6/lib
For both:
	% ldconfig

PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE YOUR OLDER libXpm.so.3 LIBRARY AS THIS VERSION IS NOT
BACKWARD COMPATIBLE.

NOTE: It is an unfortunate consequence that the binary will have the same
revision number for both R5, R6 and ELF if we continue to follow the
author's numbering scheme.
