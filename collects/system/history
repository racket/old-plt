SYSTEM HISTORY
--------------
Version 45:

- panel is now get-panel to support fancier interactions in the class
  heirarchy. The searching panel in the search frame is now in it's
  own panel, with only what sub-classes see as the result of (get-panel)
  as it's other child.
- active-canvas and active-edit can now return #f, when the active
  item in a frame is not a canvas
- all instance variables class% (e.g. edit% and canvas% on frames) 
  have been changed to get-class%, to support inheiritance.
- added extra optional arg to mred:local-busy-cursor and
  mred:show-busy-cursor that specifies the timeout
- frame title prefixes are now handled by the frame, and
  the set-frame-prefix and set-frame-title methods correctly
  update the graphical frame with it's new title.

Version 44:
- .html files (with file: links) are supported
- system now provides and uses a better dialog buildling classes. 
  See toolbox manual for more info
- changed do-eval and do-save-and-eval-or-read-avail
  to accept a range in the edit rather than a string
- added read-snips/chars-from-buffer, a function that takes an edit and 
  produces a thunk. That thunk returns either a snip or a character, for
  each character and non-text snip in the edit.  
- added a check so that edits will now save themselves in mred's format
  if there are non-text snips in the edit.

- replaced search dialogue
- new application startup procedure
- mred:frame% changed to mred:editor-frame%

- mred:console-edit and mred:console-canvas gone, use
  (ivar mred:console edit) and (ivar mred:console canavs)
- expanded keybindings -- most movement keys now
  have a shifted form that selects text
- added mred:standard-menus-frame% which gets the right keybindings for
  the different platforms
