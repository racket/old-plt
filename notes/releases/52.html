PLT Release Notes</h2>

<p>

<b>Current Release</b>:<tt> </tt> 52 <br>
<b>Release Date</b>:<tt> </tt> May 26, 1998.

<p>

DrScheme v52 is primarily a bug-fix release.
This note summarizes the major differences between this release
and DrScheme v51.

<h2> The Future </h2>

PLT intends to conduct a major release by the end of this year or early
next year. The changes will directly affect users of MrEd, the graphical
toolbox. Please expect deletions of features, additions, and a few
modifications. DrScheme will migrate to a graphical multi-module
environment.  This change should not affect beginners or teachers. 

<P>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/drschemejr/"<b>DrScheme
Jr</b></A> is available as a separate download. DrSchemeJr is a text-based 
interface with source correlation for bugs; it uses significantly less
space than DrScheme, our graphical programming environment. 

<li> <b>mzc</b> (the compiler) produces code that runs 25%-75% faster than
MzScheme-interpreted code for unit-based programs or when using the --prim
compilation flag. Significant improvements are expected in the future.

</ul>

See the HISTORY files in notes/drscheme, notes/mzscheme, and
notes/mred for descriptions of other bug fixes and minor changes.
