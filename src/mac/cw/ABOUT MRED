First, note that you don't need to compile MrEd unless you want tomodify it. The standard PLT distribution provides executable MrEdand MzScheme applications:  http://download.plt-scheme.org/=====================================================================This folder contains most of the Mac-specific files for compilingMzScheme and/or MrEd with CodeWarrior 7.2.=====================================================================To compile MrEd, just build the ppc target of the "MrEd.mcp"project. Note that this will build a number of subordinate projects,including: "gc", "MzScheme-lib", "wxmac", "wxs", and "a-list".The MrEd project writes the final application directly to the "plt"folder (i.e., two levels up from the CW projects).The projects "MzScheme(app)" and "MzScheme(cfm)" do not need to be built for MrEd. They produce standalone versions of MzScheme. More information about these projects --- as well as oe, dynlib, and thecfm projects --- is in "ABOUT MZSCHEME".=====================================================================If you are compiling from scratch, also compile the  MrStarter  MzStarterprojects. These projects create the GoMr and GoMz applicationsthat are used as templates by the "launcher" collection. Weprovide only ".68k" projects, which work for both 68k and PPCplatforms; a launcher performs little work, so there's no need tomake the system more complex by having both 68k and PPClaunchers. The project writes the GoMr and GoMz applications tothe launcher collection folder: "plt:collects:launcher".After creating GoMr and GoMz, hold down the Command key, double-clickon MzScheme, and provide the  following command line in the dialog:  -mvqL- setup.ss compilerThis step creates all of the other applications in "plt" (besidesMrEd and MzScheme). It also makes .zo files; to skip compiling .zos,add -n to the end of the command line.=====================================================================-Matthew mflatt@rice.edu
