- the language level message on startup is some strange red sexp

- in the language dialog box:
  - clicking on options 2 and 3 is strange for the printer
  - allow set! on undefined is ignored
  - show sharing is ignored

- in the lowest language level (define (f . x) x) is incorrectly a
  syntax error.

- when multiple expression are put on one line in the interactions
  window, they are wrapped in a begin. So, instead of seeing all of
  the results you only see the last one.
