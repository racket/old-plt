ABSTRACT -------------------------------------------------------------

The mail package helps programmers write programs that need to send
electronic mail messages using SMTP.  Currently the package assumes
the existence of a conformant sendmail program on the host system, but
in the future it will be extended to mimic basic sendmail behavior.

TYPES ----------------------------------------------------------------

  All strings used in mail messages are assumed to conform to their
  corresponding SMTP specifications, except as noted otherwise.

EXCEPTIONS -----------------------------------------------------------

struct no-mail-recipients ()

  Raised when no mail recipients were specified.

PROCEDURES -----------------------------------------------------------

send-mail-message/port :
string x string x list (string) x list (string) x list (string) 
  [x list (string)] -> oport

  The first argument is the header for the sender, the second is the
  subject line, the third a list of To: recipients, the fourth a list
  of CC: recipients, and the fifth a list of BCC: recipients.  The
  optional sixth argument is used for other mail headers, which must
  be specified completely formatted.

  The return value is an output port into which the client must write
  the message.  Clients are urged to use close-output-port on the
  return value as soon as the necessary text has been written, so that
  the sendmail process can complete.

  The sender can hold any value, though of course spoofing should be
  used with care.

send-mail-message :
string x string x list (string) x list (string) x list (string) x
  list (string) [x list (string)] -> ()

  The arguments are the same as that for send-mail-message/port except
  that there is one extra input, the list of strings corresponding to
  the mail message (followed by the optional additional headers, if
  present).  There is no interesting return value.

  Lines that contain a single period do not need to be quoted.
