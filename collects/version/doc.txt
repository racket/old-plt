_Version_ or _version_: PLT software online version checking
==========================================================

The version collection allows online version checking of 
PLT software.  The user-side software sends version 
information about installed software to a server that
compares that information against the latest released
versions.

In particular, the user-side software sends to the server

 - the binary version as reported by (version), a 
   MzScheme primitive, and
 - the values of the release-version and release-iteration  
    fields in the info.ss file for collections, if 
    those fields exist

If the binary version is out of date, that information is
reported to the user.  Otherwise, the status of each 
package is reported.  The determination of whether a 
package is up-to-date is made on the server side.

Two files are used to support launchers that obtain 
version information:

> check-gui.ss
  creates a MrEd launcher `Check version' for version-checking

> check-text.ss
  creates a MzScheme launcher `Check version-nw' for version-checking

These files contain modules, so they can be run with

 (require (lib "check-gui.ss" "version"))

and

 (require (lib "check-text.ss" "version"))

The launchers created from these files accept one or more 
collection arguments on the command-line, using the `-l' flag.  
If no collections are specified, all collections with version 
information are checked.  Otherwise, only the specified collections 
are checked.

Another file 

> version.ss

works like check-gui.ss, except that it is meant to be 
invoked with load, and always checks all collections with
release information.
