This directory contains experiments towards building MzScheme for
PalmOS.  It doesn't work; we overlooked an important feature of the
Palm memory system, which is that only 96k of a Pilot's memeory is
available for dynamic allocation. Of course, MzScheme doesn't get very
far on 96k. It looks like future versions of PalmOS will lift this
limit, so we wait.

The port uses PRC-Tools (available from www.palm.com) installed on
your machine, including pilrc. The Makefile currently expects the
PalmOS headers to be in /usr/local/palmdev/include/. The build process
is complex because the MzScheme code has to be annotated with section
information, so that the resulting binary is split into multiple code
resources. The partition.ss script performs some of that work.

Here's the part I always forget, how to debug with POSE:

     Shell #1                      Shell #2
     --------                      --------
  m68k-palmos-gdb mzscheme
                                    pose
                                    load gdbpanel.prc
                                      enable debugging
                                    load mzscheme.prc

  target pilot localhost:2000
                                    start mzscheme

At the time of our experiment, the debugger didn't handle
multi-segment programs very well. The debuginfo.ss extracts
information from the input assembly and disassembled output to
reconstruct useful process-address information.
