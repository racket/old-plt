2003/11/13
  * Added tabbing.
  * Corrected the handling of multiple values in test case boxes.
  * Made the empty test case error hightlight the full test case. It'd be
    better to have it highlight just the part of the test case that is empty
    but this is not possible with the current error highlighting system.

2003/10/??
  * Changed the test-suite tool to make test-case-boxes.

2003/04/23

    error message

2003/04/16
  * Added a ChangeLog
  * Added a seperator to the language menu
  * Removed model and window directories from private
  * Added an open button which opens the program being tested in drscheme. If
    the file is already open in a drscheme window, it uses the existing one.
  * Fixed tabbing so that snips that are off screen are scrolled to when
    they are tabbed to.
  * Made the save button appear when the program to test box gets modified.
  * Made the save button not appear when the test-suite is just loaded.
  * Documented aligned-snip-mixin and click-forwarding-mixin in the doc.txt
    of the mrlib collection.
