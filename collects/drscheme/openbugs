- in the language dialog box:
  - allow set! on undefined is ignored

- in the lowest language level (define (f . x) x) is incorrectly a
  syntax error.

- loading doesn't work for files saved with images (ie files in mred's format)

- load should evaluate as it loads, rather than after it loads

- when multiple expression are put on one line in the interactions
  window, they are wrapped in a begin. So, instead of seeing all of
  the results you only see the last one.
