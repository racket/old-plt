PLT Release Notes</h2>

<p>

<b>Current Release</b>:<tt> </tt> 51 <br>
<b>Release Date</b>:<tt> </tt> March 25, 1998.

<p>

This note summarizes the major differences between DrScheme v51 and v50.

<h2> The Future </h2>

PLT intends to conduct a major release by the end of this year or early
next year. The changes will directly affect users of MrEd, the graphical
toolbox. Please expect deletions of features, additions, and a few
modifications. DrScheme will migrate to a graphical multi-module
environment.  This change should not affect beginners or teachers. 

<P>

<h2> New Programs </h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>DrScheme Jr</b> is a new text-only version of DrScheme.
It requires fewer resources, but provides only a read-eval-print
loop with line-column-based error messages. 
DrScheme Jr does not provide a built-in program editor or a graphical
toolbox.

<LI>
<b>mzc</b> is a new compiler that transforms MzScheme
programs to native code libraries. <b>mzc</b> is not yet an
optimizing compiler; the performance of its output is comparable
to running the Scheme source directly in MzScheme.

</ul>

<h2> MrSpidey </h2>

MrSpidey is now distributed as a separate tool.
Download instructions are provided when downloading
DrScheme.  When installed, MrSpidey may be invoked from
DrScheme.

<h2> Networking facilities </h2>

The networking-related routines have now been incorporated into the
distribution.  They are in the collection `net', and consist of
the packages
<ul>
<li>
<b>cgi</b> provides routines for writing CGI scripts 
</li>

<li>
<b>nntp</b> communicates with a Usenet server</li>

<li>
<b>pop3</b> communicates with a POP-3 server
</li>

<li>
<b>url</b> parses and establishes HTTP connections
</li>

<li><b>mail</b> 
sends email (preliminary, currently only works under Unix)
</li>
</ul>

Documentation is in a subdirectory `docs', of the net collection
directory.  That subdirectory contains files named
<i>package</i><code>.txt</code>, 
where <i>package</i> ranges over the above names.

<h2> Miscellany </h2>

There is a new DrScheme vocabulary named "MrEd".  This
vocabulary does not provide source correlation for errors, 
but allows fast parsing and execution.  In the next release,
the MrEd vocabulary will become a language level. 

<p>

Console I/O has been sped up, and is interruptible by using
the Break button.
