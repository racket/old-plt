Implementing new Games
----------------------

The game-starting console inspects the sub-collections of the "games"
collection. If a sub-collection has an info.ss definition (see the mzc
manual), the following fields of the collection's "info.ss" file are
used:

 * `game' [required] : used as a library name in the sub-collection to
    load for the game; the library must export a `game-unit' unsigned
    unit (see MzLib's `unit' form); the unit is invoked with no
    imports to start the game.

 * `name' [defauls to the collection name] : used to label the
   game-starting button in the game console.

 * `game-icon' [defaults to collection name with ".png"] : used as a
   path to a bitmap file taht is used for the game button's label;
   this image should be 32 x 32 and have a mask.

 * `game-set' [defaults to "Other Games"] : a label used to group
   games that declare themselves to be in the same set.

To implement card games, see the documentation for the "cards"
sub-collection of the "games" collection. Card games typically belong
in the "Cards" game set.
