The drawing area should have the following features:

  At the top-left, when the window is opened for the first time,
    you shoudl see a hollow box with a line sticking out to the
    bottom left. Repainting the canvas should produce instead
    a solid box and no line. Repainting with Pixmap or Bitmap
    should always produce the hollow box and line.

  At the top, "Pen 0 x 0" in a consistent font (i.e., re-painting
    should not change the font; clicking *2 should make it twice
    a big, and unclicking should restore it)
  "Pen 1 x 1" in a possibly different font
  "Pen 2 x 2" in a bold red font (bold version of 1x1 font) on yellow
  
  A line should appear across each of "Pen 0 x 0" and "Pen 1 x 1"
    (if the line is missing, it was probably erased when the text
     was repainted, and that is bad)
  A little bit of a black line should appear before "Pen 2 x 2",
    but the yellow background should have covered up the line

  To the right of the Pen text, a black and red pair of splines should
    form a squashed "S", twice as wide as high. The "S" is formed by
    two splines.

  To the far right should be three columns of boxes...

  The drawings under 0x0 and 1x1 should look nearly the same:
    TopLeft: h-line should be left-aligned with box below it,
             but extend 1 extra pixel. v-line similarly should be
             top-aligned and 1 pixel longer. The lines should not 
             touch the box - there should be 2 pixels of space.
    Top: Lines for the rotated L's should join in a sharp corner
    Second from Top: like top-left, but lines should touch the box
                     (so only the vertical overhang is visible)
    Second from top, right: For 0x0, the X should never be
                            more than 1 pixel wide; this is a case
                            where 1x1 may be different (i.e., it may
                            have areas two-pixels wide)
    Four shape lines: First and second should be exactly the same
             shape, with the first hollow and the second filled.
             Third shape and all 2x2 shapes are ill-defined.
    Octagons: two hollow octagons exactly the same shape.
    Dot (after octagons): a single pixel
    Line: actually two lines, but they should form a single
             unbroken line
    Arcs: The leftmost should be the top half of a circle (it's
          form via two arcs); the rightmost should be a filled
          wedge from 90 degrees to 180 degress

  Bottom section:
    Images: MrEd logo (b & w)
            BB logo (color)
            Down-left arrow with a thin horizontal line (b & w)
            Down-left arrow - B & W, *not* red
            Down-left arrow - red with white background
            BB logo, possibly reddened
            Down-left arrow - red with *white* background
    Stippled boxes: In a blue box w/black border, three boxes:
                    Black and white/blue stippled arrow 
                      (white vs. blue: depends on platform, but
                       consistent across canvas & pixmap)
		     [Click "cyan" => replace "white" with "cyan"]
                    Black and white stippled arrow
		     [Click "cyan" => replace "white" with "cyan"]
                    BB stippled
		    Green cross-hatch on {white,cyan}
		    
    Dashed lines: each half green, half black, first
      with a {white,cyan} background, then a red background:
           Solid line
           Dot line
           Long Dash line
           Short Dash line
           Dot Dash line

 The drawings under 2x2 should be reasonable extensions of the
 0x0 and 1x1 pictures for a double-wide pen.

The image should look the same regardless of the top radio button
setting --- Canvas, Pixmap, or Bitmap --- except that the Bitmap
setting might produce a black-and-white image.  When you go from
Pixmap-&-*2 ("*2" is described next) back to Pixmap, there may be junk
from the *2 drawing left around the right and bottom. That's ok. Same
for going from Canvas-&-Cyan ("Cyan" is described later) to
Pixmap-&-Cyan.

Clicking on the "*2" checkbox should double the size of everything,
including the pen widths, but not the bitmaps. The 0x0 pen should
be the same width as before.

Clicking on "+10" should shift everything 10 pixels down and across.
(Even when "*2" is checked, it should be a 10 pixel offset).

Clicking on "Clip" should clip drawing to a 10-pixel strip 100 pixels
from the left. When "*2" is also clickied, the strip should grow
appropriately. "+10" should move the clipping region. (In either the
"*2" or "+10" case, the content of the strip should be the same.)

Clicking on "Cyan" should change the background to cyan instead of
white. When Pixmap or Bitmap is used, the background will be set in
the Pixmap/Bitmap, not the canvas, so a white background should frame
the cyan area to the right and bottom (if you make the window big
enough).

Clicking on "PostScript" should produce the same image in a PostScript
file.

The "icons" and "stipple" boxes just enable those parts of the
drawing. PostScript drawing of icons and stipples can be slow.

Finally, print these instructions by hitting the "Print" button at the
top of the window. The following lines are for the printing test; they
should wrap aroundneatly on the printed page. (Don't add any
newlines.) Check to make sure no lines are skipped or duplicated across
page breaks. Try different page orientations.
