* Command events: doc fields that are used by checked?, etc.

* X Windows and drawing into b & w bitmaps: black and white
  are reversed when using certain kinds of displays

* wx:dc%'s draw-arc is undefined when input isn't
  consistent with a circle

* wx:key-event% needs a set-position method

* Windows: set-user-scale with wx:memory-dc% doesn't work right

* MacOS: busy-cursor state is wrong for new windows when the
   busy cursor is active

* pasteboards: printing not yet implemented

* need to penalize the current thread more for certain primitive
   operations that can take a long time (e.g., loading a bitmap
   or saving a file)

* need range check for dc transfer modes

* need directory-selection dialog

* cursor does not change over clickbacks in embedded buffers

* Keys like KP_end, etc. are not currently accessible

* doc: [Mr] clarify "owning the caret" with respect to ownership by the parent, etc.

* doc: [Mr] "only valid when displayed": hyper-link to explanation.

* Motif: get-file dialog modality is wrong for eventspaces

* Windows and MacOS: "primitive" dialogs don't get closed by
   custodian-shutdown-all

* MacOS: std file dialog and print dialogs block MzScheme threads

* cut-n-paste within mred but across eventspaces breaks security and
  filesaving because snip class list is eventspace-specific

* how does wx:dc% get-size interact with the user scale?

* the full width for non-wrapped lines need not include the autowrap bitmap

* should use a guranteed offset for stippling in buffer redraws

* Xt: out-of-colours - widgets use too much black

* signature include: unbalanced parens => diverge?

* drag outisde view => should keep going even if mouse is still

* hidden files - add a MzScheme predicate?

* dragging selection shouldn't keep changing the auto-X-selection

* Xt: busy cursor not shown in the menu bar

* editor buffers should show a blinking caret

* Motif: menus don't work with multiple displays

* Motif: wxDialogBox doesn't obey current display for multiple displays

* add background colour for buffers?

* updating bug?: long flash, not on same line, update on focus-in

* add paragraph styles?

* need better de-fragmentation of text snips

* need to show a mystery snip icon when unknown data is loaded from a file
