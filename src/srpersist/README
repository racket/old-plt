Instructions for building SrPersist
-----------------------------------

Because SrPersist can be used with any ODBC driver manager,
we do not supply it in compiled form.  You'll need to 
edit the supplied Makefile (Unix) or srpersist.mak (Windows),
as described below.

Once you have built SrPersist, look in plt/collects/srpersist/doc.txt
for information on how to load and run the extension.

Header files
------------

SrPersist relies on definitions in ODBC C header files supplied
by Microsoft, or by vendors of ODBC Driver Managers.  Since those files 
are copyrighted, PLT cannot distribute them.  

If you are using Microsoft Visual C++ to compile SrPersist, the necessary 
files are downloadable from the Web.  You'll need to download the 
Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC),  available at 
http://www.microsoft.com/data/.  We used version 2.0; we expect later 
versions will work.  After downloading MDAC, copy the files sql.h, sqlext.h, 
sqltypes.h, and sqlucode.h to this directory, plt/src/srpersist/.

For other platforms, the Driver Manager library you choose should 
provide ODBC header files with similar names.

Windows compilation
-------------------

You'll probably need Visual C++ 6.0 installed, although other
versions may work.

Most likely, you'll be using the Microsoft ODBC driver manager.  In that
case, you can run 

	nmake /f srpersist.mak
	nmake install /f srpersist.mak

If you want to link to another driver manager, you may need to change
the variable ODBCVER to indicate the ODBC version supported by that
manager, and you will need to change ODBC_LIBS to indicate the 
libraries that implement the manager.  ODBC versions are indicated 
using C-style hexadecimal numbers.  Thus, ODBC 1.0 is indicated by
0x0100, ODBC 2.0 is 0x0200, ODBC 3.5 is 0x0350, and so on.

Unix compilation
----------------

For Unix, unlike Windows, there is no standard driver manager.
Therefore, you will definitely need to modify the Makefile
in order to compile SrPersist.  Change DRIVER_MSG_LIB to the
name of the static library that implements the driver manager 
you wish to use.  By convention, Unix static libraries are named 
lib<name>.a.  So if the library file is libdrivermanager.a, you
would have

	DRIVER_MSG_LIB=drivermanager

in the Makefile.  You need to set the variable ODBCVER to the 
version of ODBC supported by your driver manager.  ODBC versions are 
indicated using C-style hexadecimal numbers.  Thus, ODBC 1.0 is 
indicated by 0x0100, ODBC 2.0 is 0x0200, ODBC 3.5 is 0x0350, and so on.
To compile for ODBC 2.0, for instance, you'd have

	ODBCVER=0x0200

in the Makefile.  Finally, you may want to change the 
of the SrPersist dynamic library.  The variable LIBDIR indicates that
location.  

Once you've made these changes, you can compile everything by
running 

	make
	make install
