_Countdown_ keeps track of the minute and second of approaching or past
events. 

To use, first create an initialization file. Under unix, it must be called
_.countdownrc_ and be in your home directory. On MacOS and Windows, it must
be called _countdownrc.ss_ and be in your PLTHOME directory. All of the 
expressions in that file will be evaluated in the context of the definition 
`remember'. It is bound to a procedure that takes as first argument a 
string naming the event. It's six remaining arguments are all numbers, 
describing the second, minute, hour, day of the month, month and year of 
the event. Omit the year, and the event will repreat annually. Omit the 
month and the event repeats monthly, etc. Note that the second, minute, and 
hour all count from zero, not 1. The day and month, however, count from 1. 

Say, you have trouble remembering Matthew's birthday. Just put this
line in your .countdownrc and you will never miss it again:

  (remember "Matthew's Birthday November 1st" 59 59 23 1 11)

In general, remember takes at least two arguments and up to seven. The
first argument specifices the name of the event and the remaining
arguments specify the time the event occurs. Any missing arguments mean
that the event repeats. For example, if the ``years'' parameter is missing, 
the event repeats each year.

>  (remember event-label seconds minutes hours days months years)

If you want to remember an event that has starting and ending dates,
use remember-around:

>  (remember-around event-label start end)

remember-around's second and third arguments are lists whose entries
are the same as the last arguments to remember.

Countdown will periodically check to see if any changes have been
made to the .countdownrc file. If so, it will reload it.
