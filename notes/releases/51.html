PLT Release Notes</h2>

<p>

<b>Current Release</b>:<tt> </tt> 51 <br>
<b>Release Date</b>:<tt> </tt> March 25, 1998.

<p>
The following is a summary of the major changes in this release of the
PLT software from the previous one.

<h2> New Programs </h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>DrScheme Jr</b> is a new text-only version of DrScheme. It requires less
resources, but provides only a read-eval-print loop. DrScheme Jr does
not provide a built-in program editor or a graphical toolbox.

<LI>
<b>mzc</b> is a new compiler that transforms MzScheme
programs to native code libraries. <b>mzc</b> is not yet an
optimizing compiler; the performance of its output is comparable
running the Scheme source directly in MzScheme.

</ul>

<h2> MrSpidey </h2>

MrSpidey is now distributed as a separate tool.  When
installed, it may be invoked from DrScheme.

<h2> Networking facilities </h2>

The networking-related routines have now been incorporated into the
distribution.  They are in the collection `net', and consist of
the packages
<ul>
<li>
<b>cgi</b> provides routines for writing CGI scripts 
</li>

<li>
<b>nntp</b> communicates with a Usenet server</li>

<li>
<b>pop3</b> communicates with a POP-3 server
</li>

<li>
<b>url</b> parses and establishes HTTP connections
</li>

<li><b>mail</b> 
sends email (preliminary, currently only works under Unix)
</li>
</ul>

Documentation is in a subdirectory `docs', of the net collection
directory.  That subdirectory contains files named &LT;package&GT;.txt, 
where &LT;package&GT; ranges over the above names.

<h2> Miscellany </h2>

Console I/O has been sped up, and is interruptible by using
the Break button.

<p>

See the HISTORY files in notes/drscheme, notes/mzscheme, and
notes/mred for descriptions of other bug fixes and minor changes.

<h2> The Future </h2>

<STRONG>IMPORTANT</STRONG>: Expect major changes in the MrEd graphical
toolbox with version 53 or so. Likely changes include:
<ul>
<li> removing the useless size arguments for initializing <tt>mred:frame%</tt>,
   <tt>mred:button%</tt>, etc. instances;
<li> changing the "nothing" value (e.g., no parent frame) from <tt>null</tt> to 
     <tt>#f</tt>; and
<li> replacing <tt>bitwise-or</tt>ed <tt>wx:const-XXX</tt> numerical constants with 
   lists of <tt>'wx:const-XXX</tt> symbols.
</ul>
