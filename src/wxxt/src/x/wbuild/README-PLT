In an effort to make the PLT source code distribution as
self-contained as possible, we provide this corrected and pruned
version of wbuild 3.2. It is used when building MrEd from changed .w
files in plt/src/wxxt/src/XWidgets. It is *not* used by the normal
build process, unless configure is run with --enable-wbuild. (No users
compiling unmodifed PLT software will need to use --enable-wbuild,
since the wbuild output is included in the distribution.)

For a complete version of wbuild, including the pruned documentation
and meta-build files, see:
