<p>
The following is a summary of the major changes in this release
from the previous one.

<h4> DrScheme </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Scheme I/O through <tt>read</tt>, <tt>read-char</tt>, and
<tt>read-line</tt> is now supported. All I/O is specially boxed in the
interactive console to distinguish it from evaluator I/O.

<li> 
Two syntactic forms are not yet supported:<tt> </tt>
<tt>do</tt> without the step form and 
<tt>define-structure</tt> (use <tt>define-struct</tt> instead).

</ul>

<h4> Analysis </h4>

<ul>
<li>
The Analysis tool (MrSpidey) is temporarily unavailable in 
release 45 and will reappear in a future release.
</ul>

<h4> MrEd </h4>

<ul>
<li> A new construct has been added: eventspaces. An eventspace
encapsulates an independent event loop. A single running MrEd can
contain multiple eventspaces, each owning a collection of top-level
windows that are connected through the event loop, but indepedent of
event-handling for other eventspaces. This supports a better
integration of asynchonous threads and synchnous eventspaces.

<li> A prototype Web browser is available through the standard "Open
URL..."  menu item in the "File" menu.

<li>See <tt>plt/mred/HISTORY</tt> and <tt>plt/mred/system/history</tt>
in the distribution for more information and other changes.
</ul>

<h4> MzScheme </h4>

<ul>
<li>Multiple return values are now agressively supported,
and new forms <tt>define-values</tt>, <tt>letrec-values</tt>,
<tt>set!-values</tt>, etc. have been added.
<br>
IMPORTANT: The <tt>let-values</tt> of previous versions is
now <tt>let*-values</tt>. The new <tt>let-values</tt> binds
a sequence of identifier sets all with the same enviornment.

<li>See <tt>plt/mzscheme/HISTORY</tt> in the distribution for more
information and other changes.
</ul>

<h4> Known Problems </h4>

<ul>
<li>
DrScheme internally normalizes pathnames, resolving all links
to absolute paths. This causes problems with systems that use
automounting.

<li>
Even in the R4RS language level, DrScheme does not support 
case-insensitive identifiers.

<li>
The <tt>eval</tt> procedure is not supported.

<li>
See also <tt>plt/openbugs</tt> in the distribution.
</ul>
