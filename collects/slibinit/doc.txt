_SLIB_ Initialization File
--------------------------

The "init.ss" file in the _slibinit_ collection is an SLIB
initialization file (tested with version 2d2).

To use SLIB in MzScheme:

  (load (build-path (collection-path "slibinit") "init.ss"))
or
  (require (lib "load.ss" "slibinit"))     ; loads "init.ss"

That's enough if the SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is
defined, or if SLIB is installed as an "slib" collection (i.e., in an
"slib" directory in the same location as the "mzlib" directory).

Note that SLIB is not integerated with MzScheme's module system.
Instead, SLIB works in the top-level environment, and it provides its
own "feature" system that re-defines `require'.


The initialization file contains one system-dependent setting:
`most-positive-fixnum' is bound to a value that is precisely correct
for 32-bit architectures. The precise value for a 64-bit architcture
is in the file, but commented out. The only problem with using the
32-bit value for a 64-bit architecture is a decrease in performance.

No other changes should be necessary. Send patches to
scheme@cs.rice.edu.
