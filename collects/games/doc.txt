_Games_
=======

The "Games" (Unix: plt/bin/games) executable is created by "Setup PLT"
(Unix: plt/bin/setup-plt). 

Run Games and select a game by clicking one of the buttons:

 * _Same_ - The object is to score points by removing dots from the
   board. To remove a dot, click on it. As long as there is another
   dot of the same color next to the clicked dot, it will disappear
   along with all adjacent dots of the same color. After the dots
   disappear, dots in the rows above the deleted dots will fall into
   the vacated spaces. If an entire column is wiped out, all of the
   dots from the right will slide left to take up the empty column's
   space.

   Your score increases for each ball removed from the board. The
   score for each click is a function of the number of balls that
   disappeared. The "This Click" label shows how many points you would
   score for clicking the dots underneath the mouse pointer. The score
   varies quadratically with the number of balls, so eliminating many
   balls with one click is advantageous.

 * _Go Fish_ (against two computer players) - The children's card game
   where you try to get rid of all you cards by forming pairs. The
   status line at the bottom of the window provides instructions as
   you go. [The computer players are not smart.]

 * _Blackjack_ - Standard rules, plus the following specifics:

      - 1 player (not counting the dealer)
      - 4 decks, reshuffled after 3/4 of the cards are used
      - Dealer stands on soft 17s
      - Splitting is allowed only on the first two cards, and only if they
        are equal; 10 and the face cards are all considered equal for
        splitting
      - Doubling is allowed on all unsplit hands, not on split hands
      - No blackjacks after splitting
      - No surrender
      - No insurance
      - No maximum under-21 hand size
      - Dealer's second card is not revealed if the player busts (or
        both halves of a split hand bust)

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Gin Rummy_ (against the computer) - Put all cards in your hand
   into straight and 3- or 4-of-a-kind sets to win. On each turn, you
   can either draw from the deck or from the discard pile, then you
   must discard one of your own cards. [The computer players is
   smart.]

                                              - by Matthew

 * _Minesweeper_ - A simple version of the classic tile-removing game.

                                              - by Matthew
