Bugs
----

* Motif: pre-on-char doesn't work for sliders (therefore, frame/dialog
  navagation doesn't work when a slider has the focus)

* MacOS: bitmaps don't print with platform-specific printing

* Windows and MacOS: "primitive" dialogs don't get closed by
   custodian-shutdown-all

* MacOS: std file dialog and print dialogs block MzScheme threads

* Need to penalize the current thread more for certain primitive
   operations that can take a long time (e.g., loading a bitmap
   or saving a file)

Needed Features
---------------

* Need directory-selection dialog

* Keys like KP_end, etc. are not currently accessible

* Editor: the full width for non-wrapped lines need not include the autowrap bitmap

* Editor: should use a guaranteed offset for stippling in buffer redraws

* Optimization: dragging selection shouldn't keep changing the auto-X-selection

* Add background color for buffers

* Updating bug?: long flash, not on same line, update on focus-in

* Add paragraph styles
