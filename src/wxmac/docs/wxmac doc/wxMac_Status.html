<a name="RTFToC1">Known
Bugs and Problems
</a></h3>
4. Merged Tomaso's wb_ps.cc with 16.1 distribution wb_ps.cc. MW's DebugNew
crashes to MacsBug because it found a overwritten block when doing the
hello/file/print eps. This doesn't happen in all combinations of PPC, 68K, and
Debugging!<p>
11.  Things that 16.1 does that wxMac doesn't like (some of these may be new
functionality since the base 15.x version) :
<ul>
<li>	The Get/SetLabel compiler warnings are very annoying.  wx_menu.h seems to
be a major offender.
<li>	In wx_text the following methods may have not been fully debugged:<ul>
<li>	SetSelection
<li>	Copy
<li>	Paste
<li>	Cut</ul></ul>12.  Why can't an app declare a variable called 'frame' like
most of the distributed sample/test apps do.  - Because frame is declared in an
apple header, Quickdraw.h<p>
14. Need a better  scheme for preprocessor symbols Beware: Apple's
&lt;Windows.h&gt; defines __WINDOWS__<p>
18. Need real code for these classes: group, toolbar, mf.<p>
20. Need additional Cursors<p>
21. Hello.cc creates a popupmenu - how/where does this show up on a real
wxWindows system and how should the mac do it?<p>
23. Resources - how to implement ?<p>
24. Dig into dynamically tracking the thumb in wx_slider.cc. There's code in
there to try it but it doesn't work. <p>
25. There is a problem with hello.cc - MyTextWindow can cover parts of the last
control. Hello should be rewritten so that the TextWindow is not 1/2 of the
root frame but instead start after the last control. The same problem shows up
in animate.cc where the sliders panel covers part of the frames statusline.
This is not a Mac bug per-se - its a consequence of the size of Mac controls,
Mac screen size and application programming that assumes every thing will fit
in 1/2 the window.<p>
26. Maybe StatusLine widget should go on the bottom of a frame with room for a
GrowIcon and a small horizontal scroll if needed<p>
28. What I implemented for wxChoice is really a wxWindows PopUpMenu(). This may
be a problem. Is a wxChoice a keyboard enterable control or are the selections
fixed (by the program)?<p>
40. For 'ipc' samples compiled and run on a PowerPC - the 'client's PPC Browser
windows shows that "server" and "server PPC" are available targets. If you
select just plain  "server" everything works ok. Usually. May have to compile
client and server and library with wxDebugHeadersPPC (...68K) to get these to
work.<p>
43. Scan for #if 0 , #if 1 code , #ifndef CJC  and other bracketed out code -
should be removed. <p>
44. Multiline text doesn't work for me (Cecil)
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC2">Completed
(plus notes)
</a></h3>
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC3">7/9/95</a></h4>
Have a wxListBox (wx_lbox.h, wx_lbox.cc) see the top of the file for hints on
writing controls in wxMac. Still to do
<ul>
<li>How to set the font for the Lbox?
<li>Make the cell size a multiple of the font height</ul><h4>
<a name="RTFToC4">7/22/95
</a></h4>
Have a wxChoice - may not respond to OnAreaDSize in the best way. Built w/o
areas, just Mac ToolBox calls.<p>
Added wxMultiText::GetValue(void) hack<p>
Added wxRemoveFile and wxGetTempFileName - these are hacks in :mac:wx_utils.c<p>
wxPython (v01) Links,  but fails on init with a python error. WxPython sources
must have the same Code Warrior Language Prefs as the PythonLib, i.e.  Apple
C++ <i>and</i> don't check prototypes.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC5">7/29/95</a></h4>
Have a wxSlider - works with the following caveats:
<ul>
<li>The usable range is the Mac Control Managers (short int 32k?)
<li>Does not dynamically track the thumb value - see comments in wxSlider.cc
<li>#define USE_ACTIONPROC  1 -  can crash the Mac</ul><h4>
<a name="RTFToC6">7/30/95</a></h4>
Fixed wx_frame.cc (SetMenuBar)and wx_app.cc (doInMacMenu) to create and handle
the Apple menu (and desk accessories)
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC7">8/6/95</a></h4>
Fixed wx_menu.cc so that the Title of a Mac Menu can be changed. This involves
rebuilding the entire Mac Menu and all its items but does allow
menu_bar-&gt;Append(menu,"Real Title for menu"); which is how most wxWindows
Programs create menus and menubars. This is also done for wxMenu::SetTitle.<p>
If a menubar-&gt;Append(menu, "Help") is done and one of the Items in the menu
is "About", then I save the wxMenu* and the MacItemNum in the menu_bar object.
When the menu_bar is created (see the applemenu hack) I insert an "About"
string into the apple menu. If chosen by the user, wx_app.cc notes that its
applemenu/item 1 and pretends its the Help/About choice. Definately a Hack and
probably not robust. The wxMenu destructor should deactivate this if the Help
menu is deleted.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC8">8/7/95</a></h4>
Added code to wx_buttn.cc and wx_gdi.cc for Bitmap buttons. This is good enough
for Hello.cc but there is more to be done so that my scheme is usable in
wxMemoryDC (including fixing/adding code to various DC's). <p>
With wxMac you can load either named PICT resources or PICT files (pict in the
data fork), into a wxBitmap. The internal Mac object for a wxBitmap is
"Picture". Given the wxWindows definition of a bitmap, this *seems* like an ok
choice because Pictures are relatively independent of bit depth (I believe).
They might be larger than PixMaps for some images, but they are easy to deal
with. There are comments in wx_gdi.cc, but its pretty straight-forward. (I said
they were easy).
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC9">8/8/95</a></h4>
19. with PPCC compiler, linking hello gets a c2pstr undefined - because there
doesn't seem to be an MPW library with that function. However there is a
C2PStr, so all the files that need it now call for the mixed case.<p>
20. PPCC gets very annoying, spitting out warnings about inherited virtual
functions that is not over-ridden. Fixed the major offenders, not by deep
thought which what is really required. Instead I just tried a few things.
CodeWariour  seems to like them as well. This may have some part in the Hello
(MPW PPPC) bug though.<p>
21. Hello.cc works with both 68K and PPC Code Warrior compilers. Hello,
minimal, fractal, and ipc(client &amp; server) have PPC projects. Only Hello
has a 68k project, but its pretty simple to make 68K projects (4i/8d) out of
the existing PPC projects.<p>

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC10">8/9/95</a></h4>
Released alpha-1 (wxmac161d-a1) to limited group.<p>

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC11">8/10/95</a></h4>
31. MPW PPCC version of hello doesn't have working push buttons ! (it used to).
- left out an<p>
assignment from ::TrackControl. Depending on stack contents, this might have
worked (or not) with the other compilers.<p>
This time, with thought, I got rid of the GetLabel and SetLabel warnings.
Should not change functionality.<p>
Re-released 'a1'.  <p>
Starting the alpha-2 modifications which are directed towards getting the
source cleaned up and documenting (if not fixing) missing canvas, and DC
functions.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC12">8/12/95</a></h4>
13. Scan files for "CJC", "wx_mac", "OLD_HEADERS" - and review modifcations. <p>
I have made serious cuts and restructuring of the :include:base: files (and
:src:base:, :src:mac: as needed) to remove most of the passing of 'objectType'
to<i> wxb* </i>constructors . This was done to bring the wxMac modifications to
the wb_xxx.* files down to something more reasonable.  More can still be done,
but this isn't too bad. This also involved moving some lines around to keep the
style of the wb_xxx files more like the style of the original wxWindows files.
This does involve code changes to constructors, so beware: It works for me
(hello.cc, minimal.cc, fractal.cc,animate.cc (CodeWarrior)).<p>
You can scan for "CJC' and only pickup a few (3) comments. I removed the
OLD_HEADERS conditionals. You can scan for "wx_mac" as a "word" and (generally
) only pick up modifications to wb_xxx files.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC13">8/25/95</a></h4>
In Summary, we now have wxMemoryDC and wxTimer classes working. It is probably
time to release Alpha-2 Note that PPCC from ETO #17 works, and the new (ETO
#18) MrCpp fails.<p>
27. There are functions that appear to do nothing in wx_dccan*, wx_dcmem -
Started on Blit(). Seems to work with the animate.cc sample, but I need a
wxTimer that works before we can scratch animate off of the list of todo's. <p>
2. Now have a somwhat kludgy timer class (good enough for hello.cc and
animate.cc). It can only "fire" when the event loop is dequeueing events and
accuracy is in CLOCKS_PER_SEC (ie Ticks) instead of milliseconds (probable
rounding errors too!) Latency can be highly variable. <p>
Reworked wxBitmaps to be offscreen GWorlds (wx_gdi.cc, and wx_dcmem.cc) I'm not
overly confident in the destructor code though.  <p>
34. Canvas's can not be placed on a frame with (abs) co-ordinates. I've
implemented a "cure" for this in wx_dccan1.cc(wxCanvasDC::SetMacDC() ). It
seems to work for animate and hello demos but I believe this could break other
things (canvas's place in subframes of frames, or canvas's in panels in
frames).<p>
Released Alpha-2.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC14">9/10/95</a></h4>
Started playing again with wxpython (v1), wxMac161d, and python-1.2. Works
better if the System Folder has a PythonStartup file (I didn't install python
properly)<p>
22. With wxPython/wxide.cc, wxTheApp does not get init'd before the call to
main()  but Hello, Minimal, IPC, Animate do ? - Moved wxide.cc to be the first
of the cc files in the wxPython project. No clue why there should be this kind
of dependcy, but there it is.<p>
Modified wxTextWindow::SaveFile to actually save a file. This also has to
convert line endings from TextEdits '\015', CR  to '\n'. This should be
expected to need MPW conditionalization if I ever bother to try MPW again.<p>
Modified wxText::CreateText (wx_txt.cc) to handle a default (-1) value for the
height argument. 
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC15">9/15/95
</a></h4>
Added the wxextend files to the project (from wxPython v2). Lots of things
missing (toolbar, image classes), missing dialog functions,  and most
significantly wxextend assumes that wxPanel inheirits from wxCanvas and in
wxMac,  wxPanel inheirits from wxWindow. I somewhat arbitrarily coded around
and/or through them, so you should expect some python calls to fail because
wxMac doesn't <b>really</b> support them.<p>
Added wb_dialog.cc back into the project but conditionalized most parts out
since wx_mac handles dialogs in wx_dialg.cc <b>not</b> in <b>wb</b>_dialg.cc<p>
5.	wb_ps.cc - when should the dialog be called ? When getting the DC. Calling
it at StartDoc() time does not allow for a cancel in the file dialog.<p>
Added three stubbed functions to wx_gdi.h so wxExtend can go on.  Also added
Get/SetColourMap methods to wxBitmap (wx_gdi.h and wx_gdi.cc), also stubbed.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC16">9/30/95</a></h4>
Added Louis Birk's mods to wx_dccan3.cc(drawtext) to set font, size, and
colours.<p>
Louis also supplied imagif.cc and .h. IMHO the best way to incorporate these is
to meld them into the utils/image/src files, i.e. Implement the wxImage class.
<p>
By default, you will need GUSI (CWGUSI), to compile wx_util.cc and a few other
files too.<p>
3. Add wxFileSelector* functions in the "proper" place. Modified to return the
full path name.<b></b>
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC17">10/3/95</a></h4>
Released Alpha-3
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC18">10/7/95</a></h4>
I'm back to getting wxExtend/wxPython(v2) to link. - Added many functions to
wx_util.cc (which should be renamed to wx_util<b>s</b>.cc). Some of them depend
on GUSI and the rest are stubbed out! Its likely that Scott Maxwell's mods to
this file are better than mine, so I'll wait.<p>
Added conditionalisation (USE_HELP) to wxPython(wxp_module.cc).
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC19">10/29/95</a></h4>
Created a new wxpy project - this is a version of wxMac that must be linked
with Mac python-1.3. There is also a new prefix file that defines PYLIB instead
of GUSI. GUSI and Python don't mix.<p>
Change the defaults on wxTextWindows to add scroll bars and borders. Change the
defaults in wxExtend to add borders to single and multiline texts.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC20">11/4/95</a></h4>
Added xpm support via the wxWindows distributed wxxpm - modified for Mac. Test
program and project in utils/xpmshow folder.<p>
Fixed more wx_util.cc functions for path handling.<p>
Added bitmap support wxMessage<p>
Fixed bug(s) in wx_lbox.cc - was not deleting clientdata.<p>
38. Tried adding wxPython  wxextend modules to the wxMac Lib. <p>
Should modify wxExtend to pay attention to common.h/wx_setup.h idioms like
USE_TOOLBAR<p>
wxPython Assumes that wxPanels inherit from wxCanvas which is not true for
wx_mac<p>

<h5>
<a name="RTFToC21">Added
these contributions from Louis Birk:
</a></h5>
A fix to wx_dcmem that sets the gworld to null after deleting it in
SelectObject. 	   <p>
wximgfil.cc has fixes related to code that creates the rectangle for the gif.
<p>
In wx_frame.cc I added a Paint() call to the resize because scroll bars would
come out strange after resizing the window.<p>
 wx_dccan1.cc I changed the SetCurrentDC() code back to the previous rev
because the logical window positions were about 30-40 pixels different than
physical ones. NOTE (from Cecil), these break the animate.cc sample. They can
be turned on by #defining LkB at the top of wx_dccan1.cc<p>
The save file routine (wx_utils) needs to initialize a defPath, otherwise it
gets all garbled data.<p>
Implement a simple write/read resource file like windows. There is one problem:
all entry names must have unique names. <p>
Added wxGetUserHome to wx_utils (wx_util.cc) - returns current dir;<p>
Added several print related files that make up a partial implementation for
printing. It does not include the Print preview stuff as I have been unable to
complete this. Printing appears to work on my QUME ps printer. I am unable to
test through GX . Note that there is an extra allocation of a THPrint record
due to the structure of the wx_print classes. I will work on this later.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC22">11/11/95</a></h4>
Added support for wxBitmaps that can load xbm and bmp (and the previous xpm,
pict and pict resource). The default is wxBITMAP_TYPE_PICT_RESOURCE. Minimal
can be compiled to test the various bitmap formats. Additionally utils/xmpshow
can be compiled and used to browse the bmp's and xpm's. Note that xpmshow has
some bugs (crashes), in different ways depending on 68K or PowerPC.<p>
39. It would be nice to implement bmp, xbm, and ico support. - This would make
porting easier.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC23">11/23/95
- Start integrating Matt's fixes
</a></h4>
wxCanvasDC:SetBackground (wx_dccan1.cc) - some wxCanvas method calls this with
current_background_brush,  which is initially NULL. This crashes. I added a
line to return if the parameter is NULL. (I don't know if that's the right
solution.)<p>
wxMemoryDC constructor -  If MacCreateGWorld() returns an error, then do not
attempt to draw a bitmap.<p>
wxBitmap: If NewGWorld() returns  an error, then set ok to FALSE, set x_pixmap
to NULL, and don't SetGWorld() - occurs in wx_gdi.cc (wxBitmap::Create).<p>
wxMemoryDC::SelectObject: After deleting gworldH and cMacDC, set them to NULL.
(The gworldH problem was already reported.)<p>
wxCanvasDC: SetCurrentDC() needs to set the logical function, (wx_dccan1.cc)<p>
wxFont::GetTextExtent: The hack that adds 5 to the width is very bad for MrEd.
I removed it.<p>
wx_frame.h - OnChar() , Paint(), and OnCommandEvent() made public.<p>
wx_panel - AdvanceCursor() made public.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC24">11/26/95
- Added more of Matt's code
</a></h4>
Fixed a problem with wximgfil.cc for 68K (CJC).<p>
In wx_messg.cc OnPaint() add 1 to clientHeight and clientWidth<p>
Moved the kludge that adds 5 to the width in wxFont::GetTextExtent(...) to
wxMessage::CreateWxMessage when the font sytle or weight is not wxNORMAL.<p>
wxChoice::Create now defaults to a label width of 50 pixels and a value width
of 60 pixels (when no strings are provided).<p>
Added enhancements to handle wxMedia and scrolling. (wx_canvs.*). Should not
change any previous non wxMedia code.<p>
Added Cut(), Copy(),Paste()... to wx_txt and wx_text - may not be working
correctly at least for the hello sample.<p>
9.	wb_utils.cc - lots of places where we need to handle Mac pathnames. Some of
this sould be moved to :mac:wx_utils.cc <p>

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC25">11/27/95</a></h4>
Attempted to add Matts code so that wxDialogBox inherits from wxPanel instead
of wxFrame. This turned out to be non trivial (unless you have lots of stack
space for nested event loops). Pressing the button in hello failed to bring up
the next dialog and started a new event loop - simple dialogs would *appear* to
be ok. Matts code can be conditionalized in (wx_setup.h - USE_MAC_DIALOG_PANEL)
but needs to be debugged. The default wx_setup continues for dialogbox to
inherit from frame.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC26">11/28/95</a></h4>
Released alpha 4 snapshot.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC27">12/9/95</a></h4>
1. IPC code doesn't work for PowerPC (15.x) or for either processor (16.1)
Appears to be server side - try compiling with the Debug logging May be
registering in the system twice ? (PPC) Also, can't run them twice - not
deregistering (ppc and 68k)   - This bug is fixed.<p>
Hacked the wxWindow destructor to NULL out wxPanel-&gt;last_created (if the
windows parent is a Panel)<p>
When USE_PANEL_CANVAS_IN_MAC and USE_MAC_DIALOG_PANEL are both defined as '1'
in wx_setup.h, then wxDialogBox inherits from wxPanel which inherits from
wxCanvas, just like the MSW and Motif versions of wxWindows. This is the
default in wx_setup.h. USE_MAC_DIALOG_PANEL will goway in a future release (a5
or a6).
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC28">12/27/95
Adding Greg's (GRW) fixes:
</a></h4>
In the spirit of making wxWin adapt to "the Mac look" I switched the order of
OK and Cancel in wxMessageBox and wxGetTextFromUser, and added wxSYSTEM to the
list of fonts. Files modified - common.h, wxGetTxt.cc, wx_dialg.cc,wx_gdi.cc<p>
In wx_canvs.h and wx_canvs.cc, added two additional constructors needed for
USE_PANEL_CANVAS_IN_MAC.<p>
Incomplete, but functional - Improved the visual appearance of controls and
scrollbars in particular when the "frame" becomes (in)active. Much more Mac
like. - wb_frame.cc,wx_buttn.cc,wx_buttn.h, wx_check.cc, wx_rbut.cc,wx_sbar.cc
and wx_win.cc. This introduces a new method of wxButton - Highlight() which is
used instead of ShowAsActive(). In some controls, ShowAsActive() is now stubbed
out.<p>
Initialized variable 'ret' before usage in wximgfil.cc wxGIF::decoder().<p>
Add additional mouse handling code for wxFrames and remove call to SystemTask()
- wx_app.cc.<p>
in wx_gdi.cc wxBitmap::~wxBitmap() - use the short form of Disposing of the
GWorld - Louis's code can be switched in with a #define LkB<p>
in wx_txt.cc wxText::CreateWxText,  make a single call to wxScrollArea() not
two.<p>
Do a better job of postioning Scrollbars on a frame - wxScrollArea.cc<p>
Support for the built-in cursors (arrow, ibeam, cross, watch) and adjusting the
cursor as the mouse moves - wx_app.cc, wx_gdi.h, wx_gdi.cc, wx_main.cc,
wx_win.h, wx_win.cc<p>
Support for more window styles, drawing the grow icon, and resizing -
wx_frame.cc, wx_frame.h add a MacDrawGrowIcon(void) method and new update code
and drawing code.  Also mods in wx_panel.cc Paint() and wx_win.cc<p>
Incomplete fixes related to keyboard focus in panels.  Support for enter/return
triggering the default action, and tab/shift-tab cycling through the items that
want focus.  Currently, only wxText and wxMultiText accept focus.  Also, while
making these changes, I noticed that wxText doesn't really implement a single
line input like it is supposed to (this was a problem when I wanted to steal
enter/return from it).  To avoid duplicating code between wxText and
wxMultiText/wxTextWindow, I just introduced a flag to wxText that turns on the
multiple line behaviour (wxMULTIPLE).   The single line behaviour, on by
default, still isn't complete though: word wrap hasn't been disabled. Lots of
files modified - wxGetTxt.cc, wx_dialg.cc, wx_item.cc wx_mtxt.cc, wx_panel.cc,
wx_panel.h line 123, wx_txt.cc, wx_txt.h, wx_win.cc, wx_win.h.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC29">1/12/96</a></h4>
Replaced my 'a5p2' (which should have been a4p2) with Matt's (mflatt)
distribution which includes everything in a5p2(a4p2) plus fixs and changes.
Uploaded to ftp.aiai.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC30">1/13/96</a></h4>
Fixed and distributed these errors to a4p3: - (Porting:cjcfixes.txt)<p>
Added a new function wxDirectorySelector() to wb_utils.h and wx_utils.cc and
also added to new constants to wb_utils.h - wxDIR_ONLY and wxFILES_ONLY (the
later is probably not needed). If wxDIR_ONLY is passed to wxFileSelector(), it
will be handed off to wxDirectorySelector() which takes the same arg list as
wxFileSelector (most are unused on the Mac). Modified xpmshow to use
wxDirectorySelector() for testing. wxDirectorySelector() requires a special
DLOG,DITL resource (see main.[[pi]].rsrc and wx_utils.cc) E-mail with Julian
concurs that wxDirectorySelector() is a function that should be added to
wxMotif, wxMSW...
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC31">1/21/96</a></h4>
Eradicated memory leaks - Hello sample has 12 leaks which appear to come from
startup - see README:Leaks-Repair. Also, these methods now copy to wxBuffer
instead of copystring():
<ul>
<li>wxMessage::GetLabel </ul>
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC32">1/27/96</a></h4>
Cleaned up a confusion with OnSize() which appears to be only a method of
wxFrame. I adjusted code so that OnSize is only called when the frame is
maximized(minimized), it is  growzone dragged, or when the app calls
frame::SetSize().  Then I called OnSize() in wxEntry so that the startup frame
gets the OnSize when created. Now that I think of it, this behaviour should be
"delayed" until any frame is given a "Show(TRUE)" although the first wxTheApp
frame should still be done (ie two calls to OnSize on the first (app) frame).
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC33">2/17/96</a></h4>
Replaced call to Paint() in wx_win.cc with a call to OnPaint(). Applications
can now defined their canvas painting method as  standard OnPaint(). THIS WILL
REQUIRE THAT wxMac applications will need to changed.  This fix is
conditionalized #ifdef CJC_FIXES_PAINT and required modifications in many of
the internal files wx_buttn, wc_check..... This introduced a bug where canvas
scrollbars are not drawn when the canvas is positioned with the scrollbar off
screen, activated and positioned back on screen. Introducded yet more code to
wxWindow::OnPaint to check for a canvas and make an additional call to paint
the scroll bars. NOTE This looks like a kludge!<p>
Repaired wxButton::GetLabel and wxCheckBox::GetLabel , wxMessage::SetLabel ,
wxScrollBar::GetLabel leaks. Also  wxRadioButton::GetLabel()<p>

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC34">2/19/96
- Thomas Fettig's Fixes
</a></h4>
Define USE_MAC_GRAY_LABEL_BACKGROUND in wx_setup.h if you like Grey backgrounds
for your labels. Not defined by default. wxLabelArea.cc<p>
Define some additional function keys and added some internationalization.
Modfications to wx_app.cc, wx_txt.cc - Note that Tom points out a
incompatiblity in wx_txt OnChar() with Matts code.<p>
Tom doesn't lke the +5 hack in wxMessage::CreateWxMessage - but hello.cc needs
it? What to do?<p>
Add code to enable and disable multiline text mode in wx_text.cc,  wx_mtxt.cc -
Doesn't work for me (Cecil)<p>
Conditionally, add code to place StatusLines at the bottom of a frame. Visually
I like it. Note that it resizes improperly in hello.c so its not compiled in by
default. See wx_setup.h<p>
Added code to wx_panel.cc to help manage children (windows)
deletion/destruction.<p>
Improved AreaSize'ing code in wx_win.  Worked fine for me before and after so
I'm not sure what the problem or symptom is being fixed.<p>
Did not add all of Tom's modifications to the wx_win destructor since some of
them interfered with the plugging of memory leaks that I did. More study is
needed here.<p>
Restore lost line in wb_item.cc and a lost patch to wx_util.cc (oops - I know I
had it once).<p>
Released wxMac161d-a5 as soon as ftp.aiai cooperates.<p>
