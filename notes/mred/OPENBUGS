Bugs
----

* MacOS: bitmaps don't print (with MacOS-specific printing)

* Windows and MacOS: "primitive" dialogs don't get closed by
  custodian-shutdown-all

* MacOS: std file dialog and print dialogs block MzScheme threads

* Need to penalize the current thread more (i.e., swap it out sooner)
  after certain primitive operations that can take a long time (e.g.,
  loading a bitmap or saving a file)

* Updating bug? (hard to reproduce): long flash, not on same line,
  update on focus-in

Possible Features
-----------------

* Need directory-selection dialog

* X Keys such as KP_end are not currently accessible

* Editor: the full width for non-wrapped lines need not include the
  autowrap bitmap

* Editor: should use a guaranteed offset for stippling in buffer
  redraws

* Optimization: dragging selection shouldn't keep changing the
  auto-X-selection

* Background color for buffers

* Paragraph styles: more and dynamic
